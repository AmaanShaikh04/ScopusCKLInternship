Large language models like ChatGPT and Gemini have recently emerged as promising components of these tools, capable of generating personalized, conversational, and context-aware sleep guidance. This scoping survey synthesizes findings from 21 papers that explore the use of large language models in nonclinical, everyday user-focused applications for sleep health. We organize the literature into 4 core use cases: educational question answering, condition-specific support (eg, obstructive sleep apnea), personalized recommendations and coaching, and cognitive behavioral therapy–based self-help systems. We analyze the diverse data sources involved—including wearable sensor data, self-reported metrics, and synthetic benchmarks—as well as model architectures, fine-tuning techniques, and personalization strategies. Finally, we examine evaluation frameworks ranging from expert review to pilot user studies and LLM-based scoring. The review highlights current capabilities, methodological challenges, and open opportunities for advancing trustworthy, personalized sleep support using generative artificial intelligence, while emphasizing that much of the evidence remains preliminary, often short-term, expert-rated, or proxy-based, which limits external validity and generalizability. © 2025 The Authors","","","","","","","University of Manitoba, UM, (328120-352400-2000)","Grant Support: This research was supported by University of Manitoba Grant (328120-352400-2000).","Vandekerckhove, Marie M.P., Emotion, emotion regulation and sleep: An intimate relationship, AIMS Neuroscience, 5, 1, pp. 1-17, (2018); Koffel, Erin A., Increasing access to and utilization of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I): a narrative review, Journal of General Internal Medicine, 33, 6, pp. 955-962, (2018); Lin, Chihung, Roles and potential of Large language models in healthcare: A comprehensive review, Biomedical Journal, 48, 5, (2025); Bedi, Suhana, Testing and Evaluation of Health Care Applications of Large Language Models: A Systematic Review, JAMA, 333, 4, (2025); Hua, Yining, A scoping review of large language models for generative tasks in mental health care, npj Digital Medicine, 8, 1, (2025); Kim, Jiyoung, ChatGPT vs. sleep disorder specialist responses to common sleep queries: Ratings by experts and laypeople, Sleep Health, 10, 6, pp. 665-670, (2024); Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi, Assessing the Accuracy of Generative Conversational Artificial Intelligence in Debunking Sleep Health Myths: Mixed Methods Comparative Study With Expert Analysis, JMIR Formative Research, 10, (2024); Mira, Felipe Ahumada, Chat GPT for the management of obstructive sleep apnea: do we have a polar star?, European Archives of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology, 281, 4, pp. 2087-2093, (2024); Campbell, Daniel J., Evaluating ChatGPT responses on obstructive sleep apnea for patient education, Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine, 19, 12 December, pp. 1989-1995, (2023); Cheong, Ryan Chin Taw, Artificial intelligence chatbots as sources of patient education material for obstructive sleep apnoea: ChatGPT versus Google Bard, European Archives of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology, 281, 2, pp. 985-993, (2024)","H.

While WCS may temporarily relieve fatigue and enhance mood, its long-term health consequences remain controversial. Objective: To review and synthesize current evidence on the short-term benefits and long-term risks of WCS, with a focus on metabolic health, psychological well-being, cardiovascular health, and quality of life. Methods: Relevant literature was systematically reviewed, with emphasis on epidemiological, clinical, and experimental studies addressing the physiological and psychological impacts of WCS. Emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and wearable devices were also considered for their potential role in sleep management.Results:WCS appears to provide partial short-term recovery by improving mood, reducing fatigue, and restoring cognitive performance. However, prolonged or irregular WCS may disrupt circadian rhythms, impair metabolic regulation, and increase risks of cardiovascular disease. Evidence suggests that while occasional WCS may be beneficial, it cannot fully offset the adverse effects of chronic sleep deprivation.

This study presents a novel machine learning framework for optimizing track and field teaching through intelligent analysis and personalization of instructional content. This study developed a multi-layered system architecture integrating wearable IMUs (200 Hz), high-definition cameras (120fps), and force platforms to capture comprehensive biomechanical data from 312 undergraduate participants across three semesters. The system employs a hybrid CNN-BiLSTM architecture with ensemble learning methods for real-time performance analysis. Main Contributions: Our framework introduces (1) an integrated multi-modal sensing system for comprehensive movement analysis, (2) a novel ensemble architecture combining CNN-BiLSTM with gradient-boosted trees for superior classification accuracy, and (3) an adaptive learning optimization algorithm based on reinforcement learning principles. The hybrid CNN-BiLSTM architecture outperformed baseline models in classification tasks for multiple sports with F1-scores ranging from 0.88 to 0.94 and beat the traditional benchmarks by a remarkable 27.3% in time-to-proficiency and 41.2% in injury risk. Validation through ablation studies confirmed that component synergies yielded 17.3% greater performance than individual subsystems. The system shows promise for practical wide-scale implementation in postsecondary education and professional athletic training.

The evaluation system contains four fundamental dimensions: student engagement, skill development effectiveness, cognitive impact, and feedback and assessment capability. Multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) is one of the most trending systems for ranking alternatives based on their attributes. The interval-valued circular intuitionistic fuzzy set is an advanced approach for assessing MADM problems, rather than the existing simple circular intuitionistic fuzzy set. The ordinary circular intuitionistic fuzzy set lacks a concept of intervals in membership degree (MD), non-membership degree (NMD), and circular degree (CD), resulting in a significant amount of information being lost. Dombi operations are a valuable approach to improving the precision of aggregated results. The interval-valued circular intuitionistic fuzzy set-based analytic hierarchy process (AHP) provides a structured and objective framework for evaluating various innovative teaching approaches, which can be complex. The evaluation process utilizes interval-valued circular intuitionistic fuzzy set-based AHP to assess three innovative PE teaching methods that help educators and policymakers maximize the effectiveness of their instruction. In the past, various approaches were defined within different fuzzy set-based frameworks; however, they lacked a proper method for evaluating the weightage of alternatives. There is a need to define new concepts using interval-valued circular intuitionistic fuzzy set-based information under AHP for the assessment of vague and uncertain MADM problems. By applying the concept of AHP, Dombi operations, and interval-valued circular intuitionistic fuzzy set, this study develops new theories, including interval-valued circular intuitionistic fuzzy Dombi weighted averaging (IV-CIFDWA) and interval-valued circular intuitionistic fuzzy Dombi weighted geometric (IV-CIFDWG) aggregation operators (AOs). The presence of AHP in the proposed approach makes it unique from other existing MADM approaches. We also investigate some desirable axioms of AOs. We offer an MADM algorithm based on a theory developed for precisely investigating fuzzy information. Solve the numerical problem of selecting the best PE platform using the MADM approach. We are ranking the set of considered alternatives like use of wearable fitness technology; game-based learning technology; video Feedback and performance analysis; task-based cooperative Learning. We noticed that use of wearable fitness technology is the best alternative is achieved by using the IV-CIFDWA and IV-CIFDWG operators. We compare our proposed methods with existing methods to verify their authenticity and accuracy. Lastly, we offer a conclusion. © The Author(s) 2025.","Aggregation operator; Analytic hierarchy process; Dombi t-norm and t-Conorm; Interval-valued circular intuitionistic fuzzy set; Multi-attribute decision-making","algorithm; analytic hierarchy process; article; classroom learning; collaborative learning; decision making; game-based learning; human; operator; physical education; student engagement; videorecording; wearable device","","","","","","","Zadeh, Lotfi A., Fuzzy sets, Information and control, 8, 3, pp. 338-353, (1965); Atanassov, Krassimir T., Circular intuitionistic fuzzy sets, Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems, 39, 5, pp. 5981-5986, (2020); Otay, İrem, A novel interval valued circular intuitionistic fuzzy AHP methodology: Application in digital transformation project selection, Information Sciences, 647, (2023); Bozyı̇ğı̇t, Mahmut Can, Parametric circular intuitionistic fuzzy information measures and multi-criteria decision making with extended TOPSIS, Granular Computing, 9, 2, (2024); Spectr Eng Manag Sci, (2025); Wang, Jihchang, A compromise decision-support technique with an augmented scoring function within circular intuitionistic fuzzy settings, Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence, 128, (2024); Seikh, Mijanur Rahaman, Multiple attribute group decision making based on quasirung orthopair fuzzy sets: Application to electric vehicle charging station site selection problem, Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence, 115, (2022); Seikh, Mijanur Rahaman, Q-rung orthopair fuzzy Frank aggregation operators and its application in multiple attribute decision-making with unknown attribute weights, Granular Computing, 7, 3, pp. 709-730, (2022); Xin, Guan, Multi-attribute decision-making based on comprehensive hesitant fuzzy entropy, Expert Systems with Applications, 237, (2024); Garg, Gaurav, On Industry 4.0 supply chain management system in production sector using hybrid q-rung picture fuzzy decision-making techniques, Annals of Operations Research, (2024)","W.

This paper introduces a new hybrid decision-making (DM) model that incorporates the weighted aggregated sum product assessment (WASPAS) technique into the q-rung linear Diophantine fuzzy set (q-RLDFS) framework. The primary objective is to address the gap in the lack of structured and uncertainty-resistant methods for assessing AI models based on multiple, frequently conflicting criteria in the domain of PE. The proposed model presents a two-layer framework, where the WASPAS method enables a flexible scoring system by combining both the weighted sum model (WSM) and the weighted product model (WPM). On the other hand, the q-RLDFS framework facilitates high-order fuzzy modelling and accounts for hesitation in expert ratings, thereby making the decision results more interpretable and robust. To determine the effectiveness of the model, five AI algorithms named convolutional neural network-based motion analysis (CNN-MA), reinforcement learning based training optimizer (RL-TO), expert system for exercise prescription (ES-EP), hybrid AI tutor with natural language processing (HAI-NLP), and wearable sensor data mining algorithm (WSDMA) are evaluated against eight key criteria relevant to PE. Results revealed that CNN-MA is the most effective solution to implement, followed by RL-TO. The sensitivity and comparative analysis are thoroughly conducted to determine the validity of the model in terms of its robustness and reliability. The research offers distinct practical implications and actionable recommendations to educators, administrators, and policymakers, informing the strategic implementation of AI technologies within the PE domain. In general, the research makes a significant contribution to the adoption of AI in PE, as it provides a scalable, transparent, and practically applicable decision-support model. © The Author(s) 2025.","Artificial intelligence selection; Decision support system; Physical education optimization; Q-rung linear diophantine fuzzy set; WASPAS method","administrative personnel; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; controlled study; convolutional neural network; data mining; decision support system; diagnosis; exercise; human; hybrid; natural language processing; physical education; prescription; reliability; scoring system; validity; wearable sensor","","","","","","","Journal of Systems Science and Systems Engineering, (2004); Kahraman, Cengız, Fuzzy Multicriteria Decision-Making: A Literature Review, International Journal of Computational Intelligence Systems, 8, 4, pp. 637-666, (2015); Das, Ajoy Kanti, An Advanced Approach to Fuzzy Soft Group Decision-Making Using Weighted Average Ratings, SN Computer Science, 2, 6, (2021); Srivastava, Shilpa, Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) in diverse domains of education: a comprehensive bibliometric analysis for research directions, International Journal of System Assurance Engineering and Management, (2024); Chen, Weiyun, Health-related physical fitness and physical activity in elementary school students, BMC Public Health, 18, 1, (2018); Bailey, R.

This study examined whether near-viewing behaviors in college students differ based on their pre-college educational systems and whether these behaviors can be used to classify students’ educational background using machine learning. Male students ages 18–33 years who attended either an intensive (ultra-Orthodox) or a standard school system (non-ultra-Orthodox) prior to college were recruited. Refractive error was measured and near-viewing behaviors were assessed using a wearable sensor during academic study periods. Compared to standard school students, intensive school students had significantly more myopic refraction (P < 0.03), spent more time viewing very near distances (P < 0.004) and less time viewing intermediate distances (P < 0.008) and had shorter near-viewing distances (P < 0.0001). Machine learning identified far-viewing episodes > 5 min and viewing distance during near-viewing as predictors of educational background.These findings suggest that educational environments are associated with distinct visual behavior patterns that may be linked to refractive development. The ability to use machine learning to predict educational systems based solely on near-viewing behaviors underscores its potential as a tool for investigating educational and behavioral factors and refractive outcomes. © The Author(s) 2025.","","adolescent; adult; human; machine learning; male; myopia; pathophysiology; refraction error; student; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Machine Learning; Male; Myopia; Refractive Errors; Students; Young Adult","","","","","United States-Israel Binational Science Foundation, BSF, (2019053); United States-Israel Binational Science Foundation, BSF","This study was supported by the United States-Israel Binational Science Foundation 2019053.","A.

In a randomized experiment (N = 93), participants experienced either (1) a WebVR environment augmented with real-time motion tracking or (2) traditional video-based instruction. Pre- and post-tests measured conceptual understanding, while questionnaires assessed immersion, perceived interaction control (the learner’s ability to manipulate and explore virtual components—for example, zooming in on a valve assembly), and motivation. Independent-samples t-tests revealed that the WebVR-sensor group achieved significantly greater learning gains (mean improvement 12%, p <.01) and higher motivation scores (4.1 vs. 3.2 on a 5-point scale, p <.001) than the control. Hierarchical regression showed that adding perceived interaction control increased explained variance in motivation by 9% (ΔR2 =.09, p <.05) beyond immersion alone. These results demonstrate that wearable-enhanced WebVR not only boosts engagement but also deepens conceptual comprehension by granting learners a stronger sense of agency directly supporting Quality Education(SDG 4) by improving engineering education through enhanced conceptual understanding and motivation.

The objective of this review is to examine the use of wearable devices to collect biometric data combined with AI algorithms in an educational setting. A systematic review was conducted through the PRISMA methodology, by searching the Scopus database for works that included wearables, biometrics, and AI algorithms. A total of 43 studies were included and examined. The objectives, the type of collected data, and the methodologies of the included studies were investigated. Most articles utilized machine learning and deep learning algorithms for classification tasks, such as detecting stress or attention. Other applications included human activity recognition (HAR) for classroom orchestration and emotional or cognitive state detection. Many of the studies applied knowledge from previous works to the educational context, resembling exploratory research. Conversely, some authors developed tasks and methodologies tailored to the educational context. The strengths and weaknesses of the presented studies were discussed to propose future research directions. The main findings of this review highlight the advantages of the combination of multimodal sensing and predictive modeling in education with the eventual prospect of personalization. The absence of standardized acquisition and reporting remains the main barrier to replication, benchmarking, and synthesis across studies. © 2025 by the authors.","artificial intelligence; biometrics; education; personalized learning; wearables","Deep learning; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Wearable computers; AI algorithms; Biometric data; Biometric measurements; Context algorithm; Educational context; Educational settings; Personalized learning; Systematic Review; Wearable; Wearable devices; Biometrics; algorithm; artificial intelligence; biometry; deep learning; education; human; machine learning; procedures; wearable electronic device; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Biometry; Deep Learning; Education; Humans; Machine Learning; Wearable Electronic Devices","","","","","European Health and Digital Executive Agency, HaDEA; European Commission, EC, (101123009, DIGITAL-2022-SKILLS-03); European Commission, EC","This research was funded by the European project \u201CDIGital skills for transformative Innovation Management and Entrepreneurship (DIGI-ME)\u201D\u2014co-funded by the European Union under grant agreement No. 101123009\u2014awarded under the Call DIGITAL-2022-SKILLS-03, part of the DIGITAL Programme managed by the European Health and Digital Executive Agency (HADEA).","Doherty, Cailbhe, Keeping Pace with Wearables: A Living Umbrella Review of Systematic Reviews Evaluating the Accuracy of Consumer Wearable Technologies in Health Measurement, Sports Medicine, 54, 11, pp. 2907-2926, (2024); Li, Ryan T., Wearable Performance Devices in Sports Medicine, Sports Health, 8, 1, pp. 74-78, (2016); Bayoumy, Karim, Smart wearable devices in cardiovascular care: where we are and how to move forward, Nature Reviews Cardiology, 18, 8, pp. 581-599, (2021); Voss, Catalin, Effect of Wearable Digital Intervention for Improving Socialization in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Randomized Clinical Trial, JAMA Pediatrics, 173, 5, pp. 446-454, (2019); Ancillon, Lou, Machine Learning for Anxiety Detection Using Biosignals: A Review, Diagnostics, 12, 8, (2022); Pittig, Andre, Heart rate and heart rate variability in panic, social anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, and generalized anxiety disorders at baseline and in response to relaxation and hyperventilation, International Journal of Psychophysiology, 87, 1, pp. 19-27, (2013); Barbayannis, Georgia, Academic Stress and Mental Well-Being in College Students: Correlations, Affected Groups, and COVID-19, Frontiers in Psychology, 13, (2022); Hernández-Mustieles, María A., Wearable Biosensor Technology in Education: A Systematic Review, Sensors, 24, 8, (2024); Zhang, Xin, Analyzing students' attention in class using wearable devices, (2017); Prieto, Luis P., Multimodal teaching analytics: Automated extraction of orchestration graphs from wearable sensor data, Journal of Computer Assisted Learning, 34, 2, pp. 193-203, (2018)","L.

Current approaches for detecting stress often rely on self-reported surveys or single-modal behavioral data, which lead to delayed or inaccurate assessments. Meanwhile, privacy concerns associated with sensitive behavioral data further restrict their practical application. This study proposes a secure multimodal behavioral analysis framework to detect psychological stress in online learners by integrating heterogeneous data types, including interaction logs, facial expressions, typing patterns, and physiological signals such as heart rate variability (HRV) from wearable devices. The framework employs modality-specific encoders combined with federated learning (FL) and differential privacy (DP) mechanisms to ensure data security while capturing synergistic patterns across behavioral modalities. A multi-task learning objective simultaneously optimizes stress classification and stress intensity regression, thereby enhancing real-time applicability. Experimental validation on a cohort of online university students demonstrates superior detection performance compared to conventional unimodal or non-secure models, with interpretability analyses identifying key stress-related behavioral markers. The model's ability to detect stress in real time while preserving data privacy could enable personalized intervention strategies and advance the development of ethical AI-driven support systems in online education. By bridging behavioral psychology, secure machine learning, and educational technology, this work facilitates the translation of privacy-preserving stress detection into scalable tools for online learning environments. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Behavioral markers; Multimodal behavioral analysis; Online learning environments; Privacy-preserving machine learning; Psychological stress detection; Secure artificial intelligence","Behavioral research; Computer aided instruction; Differential privacy; E-learning; Education computing; Educational technology; Human engineering; Interactive computer systems; Learning systems; Multi-task learning; Pattern recognition; Physiological models; Privacy-preserving techniques; Stress measurement; Wearable computers; Behavioral analysis; Behavioral marker; Machine-learning; Multi-modal; Multimodal behavioral analyze; Online learning environment; Privacy preserving; Privacy-preserving machine learning; Psychological stress; Psychological stress detection; Secure artificial intelligence; Stress detection; Online systems","","","","","","","Butnaru, Gina Ionela, Students’ wellbeing during transition from onsite to online education: Are there risks arising from social isolation?, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 18, 18, (2021); Xue, Yaofeng, Enhancing Online Learning: A Multimodal Approach for Cognitive Load Assessment, International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction, 41, 4, pp. 2692-2702, (2025); Lawrance, Joy Christy, A Federated Learning Approach to Privacy-Preserving Data Analysis in Multilingual English Language Learning Platforms, pp. 1247-1251, (2024); Real Time Mental Stress Detection Using Multimodality Expressions with A Deep Learning Framework Frontiers in Neuroscience, (2022); Liu, Qinyi, Advancing privacy in learning analytics using differential privacy, pp. 181-191, (2025); Nguyen, Vu Thanh Tam, Examining impacts of information system success and perceived stress on students’ self-regulated learning mediated by intrinsic motivation in online learning environments: second-order structural equation modelling analyses, Education and Information Technologies, 28, 10, pp. 12945-12968, (2023); A Hybrid Learning Approach for Modelling and Analyzing Clickstream Data from Learning Management Systems Doctoral, (2021); Bobade, Pramod, Stress Detection with Machine Learning and Deep Learning using Multimodal Physiological Data, pp. 51-57, (2020); Singh, Madanjit, A Facial and Vocal Expression Based Comprehensive Framework for Real-Time Student Stress Monitoring in an IoT-Fog-Cloud Environment, IEEE Access, 10, pp. 63177-63188, (2022); Mubarak, Ahmed A., Visual analytics of video-clickstream data and prediction of learners' performance using deep learning models in MOOCs' courses, Computer Applications in Engineering Education, 29, 4, pp. 710-732, (2021)","B.

This need poses several challenges which we address in this work along with scalable solutions for behavioral data acquisition and analyses aimed at diversifying various populations under study here and to encourage citizen-driven participatory models of research and clinical practices. Methods: Our methods are centered on the biophysical fluctuations unique to the person and on the characterization of behavioral states using standardized biorhythmic time series data (from kinematic, electrocardiographic, voice, and video-based tools) in naturalistic settings, outside a laboratory environment. The methods are illustrated with three representative studies (58 participants, 8–70 years old, 34 males, 24 females). Data is presented across the nervous systems under a proposed functional taxonomy that permits data organization according to nervous systems’ maturation and decline levels. These methods can be applied to various research programs ranging from clinical trials at home, to remote pedagogical settings. They are aimed at creating new standardized biometric scales to screen and diagnose neurological disorders across the human lifespan. Results: Using this remote data collection system under our new unifying statistical platform for individualized behavioral analysis, we characterize the digital ranges of biophysical signals of neurotypical participants and report departure from normative ranges in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. Each study provides parameter spaces with self-emerging clusters whereby data points corresponding to a cluster are probability distribution parameters automatically classifying participants into different continuous Gamma probability distribution families. Non-parametric analysis reveals significant differences in distributions’ shape and scale (p < 0.01). Data reduction is realizable from full probability distribution families to a single parameter, the Gamma scale, amenable to represent each participant within each subclass, and each cluster of similar participants within each cohort. We report on data integration from stochastic analyses that serve to differentiate participants and propose new ways to highly scale our research, education, and clinical practices. Conclusions: This work highlights important methodological and analytical techniques for developing personalized and scalable biometrics across various populations outside a laboratory setting. © 2025 by the authors.","digital biometrics; electrocardiography (ECG); mobile technology; motor biomarkers; scalable research; wearable sensors","adult; aged; algorithm; analytic method; anxiety; Article; artificial intelligence; autism; biometry; clinical practice; deep learning; drawing; female; human; human experiment; information processing; learning algorithm; machine learning; male; personalized biometrics; population research; taxonomy; time series analysis","","","","","Nancy Lurie Marks Family Foundation, NLMFF, (2024–2027)","This research was funded by the Nancy Lurie Marks Family Foundation, Career Continuation Award 2024\u20132027 to E.B.T., which funded M.E. and J.V.

Despite advancements through minimally invasive techniques and multimodal analgesia, challenges such as variable adherence and limited personalization persist. Emerging technologies offer promising solutions to optimize ERAS outcomes. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are being used to predict complications, personalize recovery protocols, and support clinical decision-making with real-time data analysis. Wearable biosensors and accelerometers enable continuous, wireless monitoring of vital signs and physical activity, facilitating early detection of complications and promoting patient mobility. Remote patient monitoring platforms extend ERAS principles into the home setting, allowing real-time tracking of recovery metrics, early intervention for complications, and enhanced patient engagement through mobile applications. Furthermore, precision medicine approaches—such as pharmacogenomics-guided pain management, individualized rehabilitation strategies, and patient-specific surgical optimization—aim to tailor care based on genetic, functional, and anatomical factors. Although these innovations align with ERAS goals of faster, safer recovery, widespread implementation faces hurdles, including the need for robust clinical validation, clinician and patient education, and demonstration of cost-effectiveness. Nevertheless, early evidence indicates that technology-enhanced ERAS pathways could substantially improve patient-centric outcomes and redefine standards of postoperative spine care. As research progresses and adoption grows, integrating AI, wearables, telehealth, and personalized medicine into ERAS protocols may usher in a new era of smarter, precision-guided recovery for spine surgery patients. © 2025","","accelerometer; aged; analgesia; artificial intelligence; benchmarking; biosensor; clinical decision making; clinician; cost effectiveness analysis; diagnosis; drug therapy; early intervention; enhanced recovery after surgery; human; machine learning; male; minimally invasive procedure; mobile application; multimodal analgesia; patient education; patient engagement; patient mobility; perioperative care; personalized medicine; physical activity; rehabilitation; review; spine; spine surgery; surgical patient; surgical stress; telehealth; telemonitoring; vital sign; wearable device","","","","","","","Debono, Bertrand, Consensus statement for perioperative care in lumbar spinal fusion: Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS®) Society recommendations, Spine Journal, 21, 5, pp. 729-752, (2021); Cureus, (2024); Xu, Ziqi, Predicting Multi-dimensional Surgical Outcomes with Multi-modal Mobile Sensing: A Case Study with Patients Undergoing Lumbar Spine Surgery, Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive, Mobile, Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies, 8, 2, (2024); Cureus, (2023); Yasheng, Paierhati, Web-based machine learning application for interpretable prediction of prolonged length of stay after lumbar spinal stenosis surgery: a retrospective cohort study with explainable AI, Frontiers in Physiology, 16, (2025); Greenberg, Jacob K., Preoperative Mobile Health Data Improve Predictions of Recovery from Lumbar Spine Surgery, Neurosurgery, 95, 3, pp. 617-626, (2024); Ahmad, Hasan S., Machine Learning Models Leveraging Smartphone-Based Patient Mobility Data Can Accurately Predict Functional Outcomes After Spine Surgery, Journal of Clinical Medicine, 13, 21, (2024); Michard, Frédèric, Wireless wearables for postoperative surveillance on surgical wards: a survey of 1158 anaesthesiologists in Western Europe and the USA, BJA Open, 1, (2022); Amin, Tajrian, Wearable devices for patient monitoring in the early postoperative period: A literature review, mHealth, 7, (2021); Daskivich, Timothy John, Association of Wearable Activity Monitors With Assessment of Daily Ambulation and Length of Stay Among Patients Undergoing Major Surgery, JAMA Network Open, 2, 2, (2019)","T.T.

To create an immersive and accessible experience, the display engine of the MR display must project perceptually realistic 3D images over a wide field of view observable from a large range of possible pupil positions, that is, it must support a large étendue. Current MR displays, however, fall short in delivering these capabilities in a compact device form factor. Here we present an ultra-thin MR display design that overcomes these challenges using a unique combination of waveguide holography and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven holography algorithms. One of the key innovations of our display system is a compact, custom-designed waveguide for holographic near-eye displays that supports a large effective étendue. This is co-designed with an AI-based algorithmic framework combining an implicit large-étendue waveguide model, an efficient wave propagation model for partially coherent mutual intensity and a computer-generated holography framework.

However, its reliance on traditional interfaces often limits learner immersion and meaningful interaction. The emergence of the wearable metaverse offers a compelling solution, promising enhanced multisensory experiences and adaptable learning environments that transcend the constraints of conventional ubiquitous learning. This research proposes a novel framework for ubiquitous blended learning in the wearable metaverse, aiming to address critical challenges, such as multi-source data fusion, effective human–computer collaboration, and efficient rendering on resource-constrained wearable devices, through the integration of embodied interaction and multi-agent collaboration. This framework leverages a real-time multi-modal data analysis architecture, powered by the MobileNetV4 and xLSTM neural networks, to facilitate the dynamic understanding of the learner’s context and environment. Furthermore, we introduced a multi-agent interaction model, utilizing CrewAI and spatio-temporal graph neural networks, to orchestrate collaborative learning experiences and provide personalized guidance. Finally, we incorporated lightweight SLAM algorithms, augmented using visual perception techniques, to enable accurate spatial awareness and seamless navigation within the metaverse environment. This innovative framework aims to create immersive, scalable, and cost-effective learning spaces within the wearable metaverse. © 2025 by the authors.","artificial intelligence; embodied interaction; metaverse; multi-agent; ubiquitous blended learning; wearable","","","","","","Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, ZJNSF, (Y24F020009); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, ZJNSF; (2024SCG247); China Association for Science and Technology, CAST, (KXYJS2024008, 2023QN075); China Association for Science and Technology, CAST","This research was funded by Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number: Y24F020009; Zhejiang Provincial Education Science Planning Project, grant number: 2024SCG247; China Association for Science and Technology (CAST) 2024 Graduate Student Science Popularization Competence Enhancement Program, grant number: KXYJS2024008; Major Project of Humanities and Social Sciences in Higher Education Institutions of Zhejiang Province, grant number: 2023QN075.","Abrahamson, Dor, The Future of Embodied Design for Mathematics Teaching and Learning, Frontiers in Education, 5, (2020); Alharthi, Musleh, xLSTMTime: Long-Term Time Series Forecasting with xLSTM, AI (Switzerland), 5, 3, pp. 1482-1495, (2024); Amirkhani, Abdollah, Consensus in multi-agent systems: a review, Artificial Intelligence Review, 55, 5, pp. 3897-3935, (2022); Arslan, Muhammad, Sustainable Digitalization of Business with Multi-Agent RAG and LLM, Procedia Computer Science, 246, C, pp. 4722-4731, (2024); Ba, Shen, Measuring emotions in education using wearable devices: A systematic review, Computers and Education, 200, (2023); Barbarroxa, Rafael, Benchmarking Large Language Models for Multi-agent Systems: A Comparative Analysis of AutoGen, CrewAI, and TaskWeaver, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 15157 LNAI, pp. 39-48, (2025); Xlstm Extended Long Short Term Memory, (2024); Cárdenas-Robledo, Leonor Adriana, Ubiquitous learning: A systematic review, Telematics and Informatics, 35, 5, pp. 1097-1132, (2018); Chakma, Avijoy, Activity recognition in wearables using adversarial multi-source domain adaptation, Smart Health, 19, (2021); Chen, Hongren, Applying Smart Glasses in Situated Exploration for Learning English in a National Science Museum, IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies, 16, 5, pp. 820-830, (2023)","X.

However, current methods to assess exercise capacity are often limited to tertiary HF centers, lacking scalability or accessibility. Wearable devices can enable near-continuous dynamic biometrics including exercise tolerance. METHODS: Leveraging the capabilities of Apple Watch and a custom application, the TRUE-HF (Ted Rogers Understanding of Exacerbations in Heart Failure) Apple cardiopulmonary exercise testing study aims to investigate whether HealthKit data from Apple Watch can estimate cardiorespiratory fitness, as compared with the gold standard peak oxygen uptake from cardiopulmonary exercise testing. The TRUE-HF study will evaluate the potential impact of wearable technology in the functional assessment of ambulatory patients with HF. The primary end point is to use HealthKit variables to estimate a TRUE-HF peak oxygen uptake. We outline key features of this trial designed to reduce the burden of wearable technology. In addition, we highlight the benefits of various machine learning analyses, with a particular focus on transformer models for the wearable space. CONCLUSIONS: Using cutting-edge wearable technology and machine learning analytics, TRUE-HF may provide state-of-the-art assessment of functional capacity by measuring participant-generated free-world data.

These devices track various physiological and environmental variables, providing valuable insights into student engagement, comprehension, and educational environments. However, the extensive and continuous data streams generated by these sensors create significant challenges for learning analytics. This paper presents a comprehensive review of research on learning analytics incorporating wearable technology, systematically identifying methods and approaches that address wearable sensor data challenges. We begin with a systematic review of wearable sensor technologies’ historical development and the current state of sensor data in learning analytics. We then examine multimodal sensor applications in learning analytics and propose research and application trends aligned with educational development needs. Our analysis identifies three key challenges: ethical considerations, explainable learning analytics, and technological and data management issues. The paper concludes by outlining seven future development directions for wearable sensors in educational contexts. © 2025 by the authors.","adaptive learning systems; educational technology; human–computer interaction; learning analytics; wearable sensors","Educational robots; Adaptive learning systems; Computer interaction; Educational settings; Innovative approaches; Learning analytic; Learning experiences; Sensor technologies; Sensors data; Teaching and learning; Teaching experience; Information management; human; learning; wearable computer; Humans; Learning; Wearable Electronic Devices","","","","","Shanghai International Studies University, ШУИЯ","This research was funded by [the SISU Key Project on \u201CMultimodal Corpus for Smart Education\u201D] And the APC was funded by [Shanghai International Studies University, China].","Liu, Dingyao, A wearable in-sensor computing platform based on stretchable organic electrochemical transistors, Nature Electronics, 7, 12, pp. 1176-1185, (2024); Chu, Sharon Lynn, Research on wearable technologies for learning: a systematic review, Frontiers in Education, 8, (2023); Khosravi, Sara, Wearable Sensors for Learning Enhancement in Higher Education, Sensors, 22, 19, (2022); Al-Maroof, Rana Saeed, Google glass adoption in the educational environment: A case study in the Gulf area, Education and Information Technologies, 26, 3, pp. 2477-2500, (2021); Buchem, Ilona, Perspectives on wearable enhanced learning (well): Current trends, research, and practice, pp. 1-471, (2019); Jovanov, Emil, Wearables meet IoT: Synergistic personal area networks (SPANs), Sensors, 19, 19, (2019); Wise, Alyssa Friend, What Makes Learning Analytics Research Matter, Journal of Learning Analytics, 8, 3, pp. 1-9, (2021); Proceedings of the 15th World Conference on Mobile and Contextual Learning Mlearn 2016; Cowperthwait, Amy Lynn, Tracheostomy overlay system: An effective learning device using standardized patients, Clinical Simulation in Nursing, 11, 5, pp. 253-258, (2015); Laverde, Rubbermaid, Artificial Neural Network for Laparoscopic Skills Classification Using Motion Signals from Apple Watch, Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology - Proceedings, 2018, pp. 5434-5437, (2018)","L.

The tasks were application-oriented and partly creative. For example, a wearable device with light-emitting diodes, (ie, LEDs) could be applied to a T-shirt and used for optical messages. Our research questions related to the control-value model of achievement emotions. We measured experienced enjoyment four times and examined the dependence of enjoyment on the individual tasks. Experience of enjoyment was also tested for the prediction of students' self-efficacy for programming. The results showed that momentary enjoyment was not significantly dependent on the task situation, but it was dependent on the general enjoyment of programming. However, students with lower enjoyment scores showed higher increases in enjoyment during the final tasks than those with higher initial scores. The emotion score of the girls increased more than those of the boys but the girls' overall enjoyment scores were lower than those of the boys. Students' self-efficacy beliefs of both genders increased over the course, and some of the differences in beliefs can be explained by the enjoyment of the course. In conclusion, our teaching approach seemed beneficial for the motivation to learn programming, particularly among girls. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Lower secondary students often report a lack of self-efficacy beliefs for visual programming, especially girls whose confidence in their abilities seems to be missing. Activities that show how programming can be used in everyday life or at work promote interest and enjoyment, especially among girls. What this paper adds Experiencing enjoyment did not depend on individual task types (more structured vs. more open), but proved to be stable across all tasks. The experience of positive emotions in our computer science course had an impact on the secondary school students' self-efficacy beliefs. Implications for practice and/or policy The combination of smart textiles and programming was viewed as a motivating learning experience with the potential to foster secondary school students' confidence and problem-solving skills in computer science. A guided sequence of learning to debug can provide a self-enhancing foundation for the students' own activities with following tasks that are more open and creative approaches. © 2024 The Author(s).

This study aims to critically examine the impact of technology-enhanced pedagogy in PE by reviewing the latest research on digital tools used in teaching and learning. Specifically, it explores how these technologies affect student engagement, knowledge retention, motor skill development, and self-regulated learning. Additionally, it seeks to identify potential barriers and strategies for optimizing their implementation in PE curricula. This study conducts a literature review, applying thematic analysis to categorize findings into key areas such as wearable technology, gamification, virtual and augmented reality, and artificial intelligence in physical education. Focused on the literature published between 2010 and 2025, it was conducted using academic databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Finally, 151 articles were selected involving data extraction and qualitative synthesis of findings. Inclusion criteria encompassed peer-reviewed empirical studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses that investigated the application of technology in PE. The findings suggest that integrating technology into PE enhances motivation, engagement, motor skills, tactical understanding, and cognitive learning. However, issues such as digital inequality, lack of teacher training, and ethical concerns regarding student data collection pose significant challenges to widespread adoption. Also, this review identifies critical gaps and ethical considerations in the use of technology in PE, offering practical recommendations for its effective integration. Technology-enhanced pedagogy in PE offers numerous advantages, but its success depends on proper implementation, adequate teacher training, and equitable access to resources. However, this study is limited by the variability of methodologies across the reviewed studies, which may impact the generalizability of the findings. © 2025 by the authors.","artificial intelligence; augmented reality; digital learning; gamification; physical education; technology; virtual reality; wearable devices","","","","","","","","Aditya, B.

Methods Between 25 May 2024 and 2 June 2024, we systematically searched PubMed®, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, the Global Observatory for eHealth and the World Bank Open Knowledge Repository for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating digital health interventions for rheumatic disease management. We included studies published between 2000 and 2024 that reported on adoption rates and efficacy. Two reviewers independently screened the studies, extracted data and categorized the digital interventions according to the World Health Organization’s classification of digital health interventions. Findings Of the 455 unique records identified, 21 RCTs met the inclusion criteria. Most digital health interventions (15 studies) focused on individual-centric interventions, such as targeted communication, personal health tracking, educational tools and wearable devices. Studies in high-income countries implemented advanced, integrated digital interventions combining individual-focused approaches with health worker interventions and data services using telemedicine platforms and decision support systems. In contrast, studies in low-and middle-income countries adapted accessible technologies such as mobile messaging and telephone-based education. Many telehealth, wearable technologies and educational interventions significantly improved disease control, patient adherence, knowledge and self-efficacy. Of the five studies assessing cost-effectiveness, all found digital interventions to be cost-effective. Conclusion Digital health interventions show promise for managing rheumatic diseases. Tailoring these interventions to local infrastructure and emphasizing patient engagement are crucial for successful adoption. Future research should focus on standardizing evaluation methods, addressing digital divides and enhancing provider support and data services. © 2025 The authors; licensee World Health Organization.","","disease control; health worker; knowledge; literature review; World Bank; ankylosing spondylitis; artificial intelligence; cost effectiveness analysis; decision support system; digital health; fatigue; follow up; high income country; human; machine learning; meta analysis; outcome assessment; patient satisfaction; psoriatic arthritis; quality of life; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; rheumatic disease; rheumatoid arthritis; spinal pain; spondylarthritis; systematic review; systemic lupus erythematosus; telehealth; cost benefit analysis; disease management; telemedicine; therapy; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Digital Health; Disease Management; Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Rheumatic Diseases; Telemedicine","","","","","","","Dey, Dfiza I., Health Disparities in Rheumatic Diseases: Understanding Global Challenges in Africa, Europe, Latin America, and Asia and Proposing Strategies for Improvement, Rheumatic Disease Clinics of North America, 47, 1, pp. 119-132, (2021); Bouraoui, Aicha, The urgent need to move upstream in caring for people with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases, Rheumatology Advances in Practice, 6, 3, (2022); Ann Rheum Dis, (2023); Ade, Adebajo, Addressing musculoskeletal health inequity in Africa, Arthritis Care and Research, 62, 4, pp. 439-441, (2010); Oyoo, Omondi G., Stepping into the state of rheumatology in East Africa, Rheumatology, 51, 8, pp. 1345-1346, (2012); Pfleger, Bruce, Burden and control of musculoskeletal conditions in developing countries: A joint WHO/ILAR/BJD meeting report, Clinical Rheumatology, 26, 8, pp. 1217-1227, (2007); Olufemi, Adelowo O., Epidemiology of rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases in a Nigerian peri-urban community: results of a cross-sectional survey using the COPCORD stage 1 model, Reumatologia, 60, 6, pp. 366-375, (2022); Lu, Louie, Digital Musculoskeletal Program Is Associated With Decreased Joint Replacement Rates, American Journal of Managed Care, 30, 4, pp. e103-e108, (2024); Med Res Arch, (2023); Naredo, E., Validation and incorporation of digital entheses into a preliminary GLobal OMERACT Ultrasound DActylitis Score (GLOUDAS) in psoriatic arthritis, Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases, 83, 8, pp. 1060-1071, (2024)","A.

Design A scoping review. Data sources A systematic search was done on PubMed, HINARI, Web of Science, Google Scholar and a direct Google search until 10 September 2024. Eligibility criteria We included all qualitative and quantitative studies, conference papers or abstracts, anonymous reports, editorial reports and viewpoints published in English. Data extraction and synthesis The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews checklist was used to select the included study. Data analysis was performed using Gale's framework thematic analysis method, resulting in the identification of key themes. Results A total of 64 articles that examined the role of digital technology in the Ebola and COVID-19 pandemics were included in the final review. Five main themes emerged: digital epidemiological surveillance (using data visualisation tools and online sources for early disease detection), rapid case identification, community transmission prevention (via digital contact tracing and assessing interventions with mobility data), public education messages and clinical care. The identified barriers encompassed legal, ethical and privacy concerns, as well as organisational and workforce challenges. Conclusion Digital technologies have proven good for disease prevention and control during pandemics. While the adoption of these technologies has lagged in public health compared with other sectors, tools such as artificial intelligence, telehealth, wearable devices and data analytics offer significant potential to enhance epidemic responses.

METHODS: We combined subjective video evaluations with objective electromyography (EMG) measurements in a hands-on hypospadias training course. Surgeons wore wireless EMG and accelerometer sensors on their dominant hand while performing tasks on ex-vivo cadaveric calf penises. The study focused on 4 skills as follows: urethral mobilization, dorsal inlay graft harvest/implantation, meatal-based flap urethroplasty, and dorsal plication. Machine learning techniques analyzed muscle activation patterns and attributes for assessing surgical precision. RESULTS: The course included 18 participants (10 female, 8 males; average age 40.18 ± 8.46 years) categorized as novice (n = 10, <3 years' experience), intermediate (n = 5, 3-5 years), and expert (n = 3, >5 years). Video evaluations did not reveal significant differences due to short-term training. However, EMG measurements showed significant reductions in average EMG power, total time, dominant frequency, and cumulative muscle workload after training. Additionally, the mean power spectral density of the EMG signal decreased notably post-training. CONCLUSION: This study presents a structured approach for hypospadias training and highlights the effectiveness of wearable sensor technology for objective skill assessment. While video evaluations did not detect significant changes, EMG data provided measurable differences in skill acquisition, suggesting that wearable sensors could enhance objective evaluations of surgical proficiency in residency programs. © © 2024 The Author(s).

However, limitations include reliance on accurate biomechanical data, potential algorithmic bias in training plan personalization, and challenges in integrating real-time feedback from wearable devices. The aim is to establish a comprehensive evaluation framework for physical education, leveraging personalized training algorithms and biomechanics to enhance performance and create tailored data-driven exercise plans. We propose the Versatile Hunter-Prey Optimizer-tuned Intelligent CNN (VHO-ICNN) to optimize ICNN parameters through VHO algorithms, thereby improving performance analysis, movement optimization, and injury prevention in athletes. The BFP and BMI datasets contain data for various human features and are utilized for biomechanical analysis and optimizing physical activities in sports and education. To preprocess the data, we employ z-score normalization to standardize joint position data, ensuring uniformity across features. Additionally, the Fourier Transform is applied for feature extraction, allowing us to analyze the frequency components of movements and enhance the model's performance. After evaluation, the results demonstrate an F1-score of 92.37%, accuracy of 93.41%, recall of 96.22%, and precision of 92.95%. The results indicate that the VHO-ICNN significantly improves classification accuracy and reduces injury risk, demonstrating its potential as a powerful tool in physical education. At the cell molecular biomechanics level, cells in tissues like muscles and ligaments are affected by mechanical forces during exercise. These forces can change how molecules in cells work. When we design personalized training, understanding these cell changes can help. If we know how cells react to different forces, we can make better training plans. This can make muscles stronger and less likely to get injured. It also ties in with the data we get from biomechanical analysis and the algorithms we use. So, adding cell molecular biomechanics knowledge makes our approach to physical education and athlete training even better. © © 2025 by author(s).","biomechanics; injury prevention; muscles and ligaments; personalized training; versatile hunter-prey optimizer-tuned intelligent CNN (VHO-ICNN)","Fourier transforms; Personnel training; Sports; Technology transfer; Wearable technology; Biomechanical analysis; Comprehensive evaluation; Injury prevention; Injury risk; Muscle and ligament; Optimizers; Personalized training; Physical education; Training plan; Versatile hunter-prey optimizer-tuned intelligent CNN; Biomimetics","","","","","","","Liu, Zhewei, Action recognition for sports combined training based on wearable sensor technology and SVM prediction, Preventive Medicine, 173, (2023); Imran, Hamza Ali, Khail-Net: A Shallow Convolutional Neural Network for Recognizing Sports Activities Using Wearable Inertial Sensors, IEEE Sensors Letters, 6, 9, (2022); Zhang, Liangliang, Applying Deep Learning-Based Human Motion Recognition System in Sports Competition, Frontiers in Neurorobotics, 16, (2022); Brumann, Christopher, Evaluation of open-source and pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks suitable for player detection and motion analysis in squash, Sensors, 21, 13, (2021); Han, Chunlong, Effect of Deep Learning Algorithm Incorporating Attention Module Optimization on Assisted Training for Youth Running Sports, IEEE Access, 12, pp. 113960-113971, (2024); Liang, Wenqi, Extended Application of Inertial Measurement Units in Biomechanics: From Activity Recognition to Force Estimation, Sensors, 23, 9, (2023); Meng, Qingbo, Intelligent Generation System for Personalized Physical Training Programs and the Effect of Practical Application, Applied Mathematics and Nonlinear Sciences, 9, 1, (2024); Zhang, Li, The Capture and Evaluation System of Student Actions in Physical Education Classroom Based on Deep Learning, Journal of Interconnection Networks, 22, (2022); Ba, Yufeng, Construction of WeChat Mobile Teaching Platform in the Reform of Physical Education Teaching Strategy Based on Deep Neural Network, Mobile Information Systems, 2021, (2021); Fang, Lei, Construction of Physical Education Quality Evaluation Index and Analysis with Wearable Device, Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience, 2022, (2022)","B.

Traditionally, monitoring students’ educational and psychological health has relied primarily on teachers, a method that is both inefficient and inadequate for comprehensively grasping students’ needs. Therefore, the application of artificial intelligence is particularly critical. GenAI has the capability to gather semantic information from consumer electronics commonly used by students, such as smartphones, wearable devices, and tablets, and perform in-depth analysis. By analyzing curriculum schedules, GenAI can personalize learning paths and predict students’ psychological states through examining individual mental health and media usage data. This article explores how GenAI processes this information to intervene in students’ education and psychological health, and discusses the analysis of adolescent mental health test data collected in recent years as well. Evidence suggests that students enrolled in high schools suffer from the highest rates of depression and major depressive disorder compared to other stages, at 40% and 12.5%, respectively, underscoring the importance of using GenAI for educational and psychological health monitoring. The article summarizes the relevant technologies and models, highlighting the potential of GenAI in enhancing student well-being and academic performance. © 2012 IEEE.","","Curricula; Electronic assessment; Electronic health record; mHealth; Students; Teaching; Artificial intelligence technologies; Mental health; Psychological health; Psychology; Semantics Information; Smart phones; Teachers'; Technology advances; Users' experiences; Wearable devices; Smartphones","","","","","Macau University of Science and Technology, MUST, (FRG-22-098-FA-002 A); (2023K252, 2023K248); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, ZJNSF, (LGF20F03003, LQ23F020001); (231100751160537)","This work was supported in part by the Zhejiang Provincial Natu ral Science Foundation of China under Grant LQ23F020001, Grant LGF20F03003; in part by the Quzhou City Science and Technology Project under Grant 2023K252 and Grant 2023K248; in part by The Faculty Research Grants of Macau University of Science and Technology under Grant FRG-22-098-FA-002 A; in part by The University-Industry Collaborative Education Program under Grant 231100751160537.","Wang, Tingting, Deep-Learning-Based Weak Electromagnetic Intrusion Detection Method for Zero Touch Networks on Industrial IoT, IEEE Network, 36, 6, pp. 236-242, (2022); Ye, Yinghui, Resource Allocation in Backscatter-Assisted Wireless Powered MEC Networks With Limited MEC Computation Capacity, IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, 21, 12, pp. 10678-10694, (2022); Hossain, Bayzid Ashik, Natural Language-Based Conceptual Modelling Frameworks: State of the Art and Future Opportunities, ACM Computing Surveys, 56, 1, (2024); Breit, Anna, Combining Machine Learning and Semantic Web: A Systematic Mapping Study, ACM Computing Surveys, 55, 14 S, (2023); Yang, Xin, Semantic perceptive infrared and visible image fusion Transformer, Pattern Recognition, 149, (2024); Lim, Weng Marc, Generative AI and the future of education: Ragnarök or reformation?

The concept was developed to account for the discrepancy between pathology and clinical manifestation. In neuroscience, motor, brain and cognitive reserves are abstract measures, conceptually defined yet elusive to quantify. Reserve is indirectly assessed using proxies such as years of education and brain volume, limiting its utility. Moreover, the dichotomy in definitions of cognitive and motor reserves is artificial, as daily function requires an intricate network of connections between these domains. Here, we assessed the validity of a newly developed graded motor cognitive ‘stress test’ to quantify the combined motor and cognitive reserve (MCR). The study included 144 participants (ages between 18 and 85, 50% women) with a range of reserve capacities (i.e. healthy young and older adults and individuals with Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies and mild cognitive impairment). The assessment included walking on a treadmill while negotiating motor and cognitive challenges delivered using virtual reality. To establish an MCR index score, we used a semi-supervised machine learning algorithm. The model includes performance measures from completing the stress test and measures obtained from wearable sensors used during the test. Validation of the proposed MCR index was examined through: (i) model face validity–reflecting decline of performance as challenge increased; (ii) known-groups validity—classification of scores according to neurological status; (iii) construct validity (convergent)—association with common MCRs proxies as well as MRI-derived regional brain volumes. The model’s face validity revealed decreased performance with increased motor and cognitive challenges (both domains P < 0.001). The index accurately discriminated between healthy controls and those diagnosed with neurological conditions with an area under the curve of 0.89 [95% CI: 0.79–0.99] which was significantly higher than all other commonly used proxies. Statistically significant Spearman’s ρ correlations were observed with all commonly used motor and cognitive proxies (0.56 ≤ r ≤ 0.79, after multiplicity correction all P < 0.05), reflecting construct validity. In addition, statistically significant correlations were observed between the MCR index and whole-brain grey matter and white matter volumes (r = 0.63 and 0.55), as well as the pre-defined left and right caudate nucleus (r = 0.56 and 0.68) and inferior-frontal gyrus (r = 0.47 and 0.58). This proof-of-concept study shows that the novel MCR index is valid, with high sensitivity to neurological deficits and is able to quantify reserve on an individual level. This new innovative tool can assist in screening for motor cognitive deficits and potentially, for predicting motor and cognitive decline associated with neurodegenerative disease. © The Author(s) 2025.

By examining 78 peer-reviewed articles published over the past nine years (2016-2024), the paper addresses two core research questions in IVR learning environments: 1) What are the main multimodal learning indicators? 2) What are the ethical considerations associated with multimodal learning analysis? The findings indicate that cognitive indicators are dominant, while studies on emotional and affective learning indicators remain scarce. Real-time monitoring of cognitive load and dynamic task adjustment mechanisms have yet to be fully implemented, suggesting future research on the design of adaptive learning tasks. Additionally, the review calls for improvements in both technological and ethical frameworks to address issues related to privacy, transparency, and fairness.

Objective: This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the clinical effectiveness of multidisciplinary rehabilitation strategies—including strength training, neuromuscular re-education, psychological readiness, blood flow restriction (BFR) therapy, and wearable sensor technologies—on functional recovery and RTS outcomes post-ACLR. Methods: Based on bibliometric trends showing substantial growth in ACLR research, a comprehensive literature search of Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore databases from 2018 to 2024 was conducted. A total of 73 studies were included. Pooled standardized mean differences (SMDs) were computed using random-effects meta-analyses. Methodological quality and evidence strength were assessed via AMSTAR-2 and GRADE tools. Results: Strength and neuromuscular training significantly enhanced quadriceps recovery and limb symmetry (SMD = 0.64; p < 0.01), while BFR therapy showed large effects on hypertrophy and early function (SMD = 1.28; p < 0.0001). Psychological readiness (e.g., ACL-RSI, IKDC) strongly predicted RTS (SMD = 0.82; p < 0.0001). Wearable sensors and machine learning models improved gait tracking and RTS prediction (SMD = 0.46; p < 0.0001), though protocol variability persisted. Conclusion: Multimodal rehabilitation integrating physical, psychological, and technological domains optimizes RTS outcomes post-ACLR. Standardizing intervention criteria and validating sensor-based and AI-supported tools are essential next steps for evidence-based clinical translation.

Chan School of Public Health, Boston, MA, United States; Wilhelm, Sabine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, United States","Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is characterized by distressing preoccupations with perceived appearance flaws, leading to functional impairment and suicidal ideation (SI). Traditional approaches for monitoring clinical deterioration in BDD include self-reports and clinician assessments, which can miss acute changes in risk due to infrequent administration and recall biases. Alternatively, real-time monitoring via smartphones and wearable devices can enable low-burden early detection of deterioration, identifying intervention opportunities before someone’s condition critically worsens. This study tests the feasibility of using smartphone sensor and demographic data to predict daily clinical acuity. Eighty-two participants with BDD completed ecological momentary assessments (EMA) over 28 days, reporting levels of SI, BDD-related avoidance, and time spent on BDD-related concerns. Smartphone sensor data were collected for 3 months that overlapped with EMA. Machine learning models were trained to predict same-day levels of SI, avoidance, and time spent on BDD using the Global Positioning System (GPS), accelerometer, and demographic data. We evaluated model performance using mean absolute error, Pearson and Spearman correlations, and permutation tests. Random forest(RF) models using time and random split validation outperformed dummy regressor models across outcomes (maximum SI, mean SI, maximum avoidance, mean avoidance, time spent on BDD-related behaviors). Pearson correlations for RF models showed strong predictive performance for BDD-related time (r = .74–.75) and mean and max SI (r = .70–.73). Mean and max avoidance was moderately well predicted (r = .56–.62). Step count and demographic factors (e.g., education, living situation) were the most consistent and important features. This study provides initial evidence that smartphone sensor and demographic data can be used to monitor real-time clinical worsening in BDD, without burdening the patient. This work has potential for building just-in-time interventions that are delivered as deterioration onsets, to prevent its escalation. Future research should test these models in real-world datasets collected over longer periods and subsequently explore integration into interventions and clinical decision making.

It originates from multiple sources and can be classified into different types and categories. Physiological stress, exerts high pressure on the human body, disrupting daily activities and overall well-being. Prolonged exposure to elevated stress levels may lead to severe health complications, including cardiovascular diseases and other stress-induced disorders. To mitigate these risks, it is crucial to continuously monitor stress levels, enabling early detection and timely intervention. This systematic review explores various stress detection methodologies, including data-driven approaches that leverage online social networks (OSNs) and physiological signals, such as Electroencephalography (EEG) and Electrocardiography (ECG). Additionally, it explores stress indicators derived from wearable devices, including Galvanic Skin Response (GSR), and Skin Temperature (ST). The study further investigates the application of Machine Learning (ML) techniques and Deep Learning (DL) techniques in examining these signals to improve the accuracy of stress detection. Furthermore, this paper examines the utilization of stress detection models across multiple sectors, including the workplace, education, and the automotive industry. It also highlights key research aspects such as objectives, data sources, data analysis, ML or DL methodologies, and model performance evaluation. The review follows the PICO framework (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) to systematically identify relevant studies, define inclusion criteria, and evaluate the impact of computational models on stress detection outcomes.

This study presents a novel stress-monitoring framework designed for high-pressure manufacturing environments, seamlessly integrating IoT, AI, and advanced data analytics. Leveraging data from IoT-enabled wearable devices, we developed a robust machine learning model. A rigorous methodology guided the development and evaluation of four classifiers: Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees (DT), and XGBoost, with RF proving most effective for our dataset. We initially selected 35 candidate models, establishing a baseline with an RF model due to its strength in handling data complexity. To assess generalizability, another candidate model was randomly chosen to simulate unseen data. A key component was the use of SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) for feature engineering, enhancing model transparency by offering insights into feature importance and decision-making. Additionally, SMOTE addressed class imbalance, while Optuna fine-tuned hyperparameters for improved generalization. The best model achieved 97.40% accuracy (Random Forest) in distinguishing between stressed and non-stressed states. This study applied the advanced method toward Industry 4.0 alongside advancements in smart manufacturing, emphasizing the importance of worker productivity and well-being. As a result, this application of machine learning empowers manufacturers to enhance operational efficiency, reduce costs, and maintain a high standard of product quality. © © 2025 by ASME.","Explainable AI; human-centered manufacturing; physiological stress monitoring; Random Forest optimization","Advanced Analytics; Assembly; Decision trees; Engineering education; Industry 4.0; Learning systems; Machine learning; Nearest neighbor search; Occupational risks; Random forests; Smart manufacturing; Wearable technology; Assembly line; Explainable AI; Human-centered manufacturing; Optimisations; Physiological stress; Physiological stress monitoring; Random forest optimization; Shapley; Stress monitoring; Assembly machines","","","","","","","Proceedings of the Conference on Learning Factories Cfl, (2021); Advanced Manufacturing and Automation Viii, (2018); Yang, Muchen, Simulation System of Automobile Rear Axle Assembly Line Based on Cyber-Physical System, Chinese Control Conference, CCC, 2021-July, pp. 4690-4695, (2021); Liu, Guanting, Hand-detection with Transferrable Design for Smart Factories, (2021); Benotsmane, Rabab, Economic, social impacts and operation of smart factories in Industry 4.0 focusing on simulation and artificial intelligence of collaborating robots, Social Sciences, 8, 5, (2019); IEEE Access, (2018); undefined, (2025); Proceedings of the IEEE, (2020); How Sun Automation Revolutionized an Industry with A Ground Breaking Predictive Maintenance Solution, (2023); Watanabe, Keijiro, Search algorithm of the assembly sequence of products by using past learning results, International Journal of Production Economics, 226, (2020)","","","American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME)","Manufacturing Engineering Division (MED) of ASME","ASME 2025 20th International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference, MSEC 2025","2025-06-23 through 2025-06-27","Greenville","213371","","9780791889015; 9780791889022","","","English","Proc.

In traditional ways, however, evaluation can be inefficient and subjective, which results in uneven judgments. Here, this research suggests a neural network-based method to assess PE instruction quality in order to overcome the shortcomings of traditional methods. The study considers critical performance indicators like instructor efficacy, student engagement, and course design, employing a Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN) to analyse. For better accuracy, a hybrid Genetic Algorithm-Optimized Neural Network (GA-NN) is proposed, which enhances the convergence and reliability of prediction. The dataset includes structured questionnaires, expert scores, and student opinions across several colleges, which are Student Feedback & Course Evaluations, Expert & Peer Observation Scores, Wearable Sensor & Biometric Data, Institutional Academic Records, Video-Based Teaching Assessments, provides thorough analysis. Experimental results exhibit 98.3% classification accuracy, precision, recall, and F1score higher than 90 %, outperforming conventional methods. The originality comes from the adaptive optimization of neural networks for dynamic PE teaching settings, offering an intelligent, data-driven assessment framework.

Despite advancements in training science, conventional approaches still rely heavily on subjective assessments and uniform regimens, failing to accommodate individual differences in learning styles, biomechanics, cognitive load, and psychological resilience. This study addresses this gap by investigating the role of AI technologies - specifically machine learning algorithms, neural networks, augmented reality (AR), and motion capture systems - in optimizing tennis player recruitment and training personalization. A controlled experimental design was employed, involving 30 amateur and intermediate tennis players divided into AI-assisted and traditional training groups. AI tools such as motion capture systems, wearable sensors, and predictive neural network models were used to assess performance metrics, injury risk, and psychological readiness. The study found that players in the AI-supported group demonstrated significantly greater improvements in stroke accuracy (↑14.8%), serve speed (↑13.4 km/h), and reaction time (↓29 ms), along with a 60% reduction in injury occurrence and higher satisfaction scores across multiple training dimensions. Our contributions include: (1) a hybrid framework for integrating AI technologies into tennis training and talent identification; (2) empirical validation of AI's effectiveness in enhancing performance and injury prevention; and (3) thematic insights on adaptability and psychological impact from athletes using AI tools.

The growing ubiquity of wearable devices enables continuous monitoring of activity levels, providing a new avenue for data-driven detection and severity assessment of depression. However, existing machine learning models often exhibit lower performance when distinguishing overlapping subtypes of depression and frequently lack explainability, an essential component for clinical acceptance. Objective: This study aimed to develop and evaluate an interpretable machine learning framework for detecting depression and classifying its severity using wearable-actigraphy data, while addressing common challenges such as imbalanced datasets and limited model transparency. Methods: We used the Depresjon dataset and applied Adaptive Synthetic Sampling (ADASYN) to mitigate class imbalance. We extracted multiple statistical features (eg, power spectral density mean and autocorrelation) and demographic attributes (eg, age) from the raw activity data. Five machine learning algorithms (logistic regression, support vector machines, random forest, XGBoost, and neural networks) were assessed via accuracy, precision, recall, F<inf>1</inf>-score, specificity, and Matthew correlation constant. We further used Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) to elucidate prediction drivers. Results: XGBoost achieved the highest overall accuracy of 84.94% for binary classification and 85.91% for multiclass severity. SHAP and LIME revealed power spectral density mean, age, and autocorrelation as top predictors, highlighting circadian disruptions’ role in depression. Conclusions: Our interpretable framework reliably identifies depressed versus nondepressed individuals and differentiates mild from moderate depression. The inclusion of SHAP and LIME provides transparent, clinically meaningful insights, emphasizing the potential of explainable artificial intelligence to enhance early detection and intervention strategies in mental health care. © Iftikhar Ahmed, Anushree Brahmacharimayum, Raja Hashim Ali, Talha Ali Khan, Muhammad Ovais Ahmad.","activity data; artificial intelligence; depression; explainable AI; machine learning; mental health","accuracy; actimetry; algorithm; Article; artificial neural network; autocorrelation; binary classification; cell differentiation; circadian rhythm; confusion matrix; controlled study; decision making; decision tree; depression; diagnostic value; education; ensemble learning; entropy; evaluation study; explainable artificial intelligence; explainable machine learning; female; human; hyperactivity; irregular sleep-wake rhythm disorder; lethargy; local interpretable model agnostic explanation; machine learning; machine learning algorithm; major depression; male; melancholia; mental disease; mental health care; mental instability; Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale; mood change; mood disorder; motor activity; multiclass classification; nerve cell network; performance indicator; personalized medicine; power spectrum; prediction; sex difference; Shapley additive explanation; sleep; sleep hygiene; sleep waking cycle; support vector machine","","","","","","","Santomauro, Damian Francesco, Global prevalence and burden of depressive and anxiety disorders in 204 countries and territories in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, The Lancet, 398, 10312, pp. 1700-1712, (2021); BMJ, (2016); Varma, Prerna, Younger people are more vulnerable to stress, anxiety and depression during COVID-19 pandemic: A global cross-sectional survey, Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry, 109, (2021); Depressive Disorder Depression Who Int 2023; Suicide India Who Int; Depression, (2022); Tolentino, Julio Cesar, DSM-5 criteria and depression severity: Implications for clinical practice, Frontiers in Psychiatry, 9, OCT, (2018); McKee, Jerry R., Medical mimics: Differential diagnostic considerations for psychiatric symptoms, Mental Health Clinician, 6, 6, pp. 289-296, (2016); Currier, M.

To address this gap, the TexP@ct Consortium is developing a Smart Vest for Physical Education (SV4PE)-a textile engineered wearable solution that integrates a single triaxial Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and electrocardiogram (ECG) sensors, embedded at the T8 spinal level. Designed for comfortable and unobtrusive use, the SV4PE enables recording and analysis of biomechanical and physiological data during physical activity. This paper presents the preliminary system validation and algorithm development for the SV4PE system, detailing the sensor fusion and signal processing methods used to extract metrics from live and recorded data, along with results from experimental and prototype datasets. The algorithms designed measure an athlete's heart rate, movement intensity, and effort, with additional post-exercise metrics to characterize fundamental movements such as walking, running, and jumping. Sensor fusion packages were implemented, combining acceleration and angular velocity, to correct sensor drifts and remove gravity components. Following filtering and resampling, walking and running metrics, such as cadence, distance and velocity, are extracted through gait event identification, using wavelet transforms. Jumping characteristics are derived from vertical acceleration using projectile motion equations to estimate jump height, take-off force, and power output. Lastly, heart rate is calculated from QRS peak detection in the ECG signal, and associated with subject metadata to evaluate exercise intensity and effort levels. Additional algorithms are under-development to assess fitness tests (e.g., mile run, shuttle run, push-ups, etc.), for team sport motion classification using machine learning, and for player localization within a playfield for detailed performance analysis. Ultimately, this work seeks to provide teachers and trainers with practical tools to objectively monitor and assess children's performance during sports and physical activities. © 2025 IEEE.","ECG; IMU; Physical Education; Smart Textiles","Biomedical signal processing; Equations of motion; Filtration; Heart; Learning systems; Motion analysis; Personnel training; Sports; Textiles; Wavelet transforms; Wearable sensors; Assessment metric; Athletic performance; Biomechanical data; Children healths; Heart-rate; Inertial measurements units; Physical activity; Physical education; Physiological data; Sensor fusion; Electrocardiography","","","","","European Commission, EC","This work is co-financed by Component 5 - Capitalization and Business Innovation, integrated in the Resilience Dimension of the Recovery and Resilience Plan within the scope of the Recovery and Resilience Mechanism (MRR) of the European Union (EU), framed in the Next Generation EU, for the period 2021 - 2026, within project TEXP@CT, with reference 61.","Sirard, John Ronald, Physical activity assessment in children and adolescents, Sports Medicine, 31, 6, pp. 439-454, (2001); Armitano-Lago, Cortney N., A SWOT Analysis of Portable and Low-Cost Markerless Motion Capture Systems to Assess Lower-Limb Musculoskeletal Kinematics in Sport, Frontiers in Sports and Active Living, 3, (2022); Lopez-Nava, Irvin Hussein, Wearable Inertial Sensors for Human Motion Analysis: A Review, IEEE Sensors Journal, 16, 22, pp. 7821-7834, (2016); Zrenner, Markus, Comparison of different algorithms for calculating velocity and stride length in running using inertial measurement units, Sensors, 18, 12, (2018); Donahue, Seth R., Validation of Running Gait Event Detection Algorithms in a Semi-Uncontrolled Environment, Sensors, 22, 9, (2022); Bailey, G.

The research investigates how intrinsic motivational factors (perceived competence, autonomy, and relatedness from SDT) and behavioral intentions (from TPB and TAM) together affect educators’ decisions to adopt wearable technologies. Using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), data from 338 physical education teachers were analyzed to evaluate the proposed theoretical model. Results indicate that internal motivational dynamics significantly shape teachers’ openness to and intentions toward integrating wearable devices, alongside perceptions of the technology’s ease of use and usefulness. The findings underscore the importance of aligning technological tools with educators’ professional motivations and educational objectives to promote successful technology integration. This research advances the theoretical understanding of technology adoption in education and offers practical insights for designing professional development and policy initiatives.

Artificial intelligence (AI) systems and wearable sensors hold potential for PD diagnosis, personalized symptom monitoring, and progression prediction. Nonetheless, ethical AI adoption requires several core principles, including user trust, transparency, fairness, and human oversight. Objective: This study aims to explore and synthesize the perspectives of diverse stakeholders, such as individuals living with PD, health care professionals, AI experts, and bioethicists. The aim was to guide the development of AI-driven digital health solutions, emphasizing transparency, data security, fairness, and bias mitigation while ensuring robust human oversight. These efforts are part of the broader Artificial Intelligence-Based Parkinson’s Disease Risk Assessment and Prognosis (AI-PROGNOSIS) European project, dedicated to advancing ethical and effective AI applications in PD diagnosis and management. Methods: An exploratory qualitative approach, based on 2 datasets constructed from cocreation workshops, engaged key stakeholders with diverse expertise to gather insights, ensuring a broad range of perspectives and enriching the thematic analysis. A total of 24 participants participated in the cocreation workshops, including 11 (46%) people with PD, 6 (25%) health care professionals, 3 (13%) AI technical experts, 1 (4%) bioethics expert, and 3 (13%) facilitators. Using a semistructured guide, key aspects of the discussion centered on trust, fairness, explainability, autonomy, and the psychological impact of AI in PD care. Results: Thematic analysis of the cocreation workshop transcripts identified 5 key main themes, each explored through various corresponding subthemes. AI trust and security (theme 1) was highlighted, focusing on data safety and the accuracy and reliability of the AI systems. AI transparency and education (theme 2) emphasized the need for educational initiatives and the importance of transparency and explainability of AI technologies. AI bias (theme 3) was identified as a critical theme, addressing issues of bias and fairness and ensuring equitable access to AI-driven health care solutions. Human oversight (theme 4) stressed the significance of AI-human collaboration and the essential role of human review in AI processes. Finally, AI’s psychological impact (theme 5) examined the emotional impact of AI on patients and how AI is perceived in the context of PD care. Conclusions: Our findings underline the importance of implementing robust security measures, developing transparent and explainable AI models, reinforcing bias mitigation and reduction strategies and equitable access to treatment, integrating human oversight, and considering the psychological impact of AI-assisted health care. These insights provide actionable guidance for developing trustworthy and effective AI-driven digital PD diagnosis and management solutions. ©Beatriz Alves, Ghada Alhussein, Sara Riggare, Therese Scott Duncan, Ali Saad, David M Lyreskog, Christos Chatzichristos, Ioannis Gerasimou, Stelios Hadjidimitriou, Leontios J Hadjileontiadis, Sofia B Dias, AI-PROGNOSIS Consortium.","advanced care strategies; artificial intelligence; artificial intelligence; assessment; cocreation; digital health care solutions; disease risk; Parkinson disease management; prognosis; stakeholder insights; trust in AI systems","access to treatment; adult; Article; artificial intelligence; bias mitigation; bioethics; disease risk assessment; explainable artificial intelligence; fairness; female; health care personnel; human; information security; major clinical study; male; Parkinson disease; prediction; prevalence; prognosis; reliability; thematic analysis; workshop; diagnosis; ethics; qualitative research; stakeholder participation; therapy; trust; Artificial Intelligence; Humans; Parkinson Disease; Qualitative Research; Stakeholder Participation; Trust","","","","","European Health and Digital Executive Agency, HaDEA; European Commission, EC, (101080581)","The authors extend their gratitude to the patient panel members from France, Germany, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom for their voluntary participation in this study.

These advancements offer a data-driven approach to personalized training, enhancing both individual and group fitness programs. However, existing methods rely on generalized training plans that fail to address individual needs, leading to inefficiencies in performance improvement and injury prevention. Additionally, traditional fitness monitoring lacks real-time feedback, limiting users' ability to adjust workouts dynamically. To address these limitations, we propose a Cloud-based AI Analytics for Personalized Training Plans (C-AI-PTP) framework. This system integrates wearable sensors, IoT devices, and cloud computing to analyze physiological and biomechanical data in real time. AI-driven analytics generate personalized training recommendations based on users' fitness levels, goals, and real-time performance metrics. The proposed method allows continuous monitoring, adaptive feedback, and data-driven adjustments, enhancing training efficiency and reducing the risk of injuries. Coaches and educators can also use aggregated insights to design optimized physical education programs. Our findings demonstrate that C-AI-PTP significantly improves workout effectiveness, motivation, and injury prevention. Personalized insights enhance user engagement, while AI-powered analytics refine training plans over time. This approach marks a transformative shift in fitness and physical education, fostering a more intelligent, adaptive, and effective training system. © 2025 IEEE.","AI-driven Analytics; Cloud-based Fitness System; Internet of Things (IoT); Personalized Training; Wearable Technology","Artificial intelligence; Cloud analytics; Engineering education; Feedback; Learning systems; Wearable computers; Wearable sensors; AI-driven analytic; Cloud-based; Cloud-based fitness system; Injury prevention; Internet of thing; Personalized training; Physical education; Physical education trainings; Training plan; Training Systems; Internet of things","","","","","","","D., Integration of wearable smart devices and internet of things technology into public physical education, Mobile Information Systems, 2021, (2021); International Journal of Advances in Engineering and Emerging Technology, (2018); J., Wearables and internet of things (Iot) technologies for fitness assessment: A systematic review, Sensors, 21, 16, (2021); International Academic Journal of Innovative Research, (2015); Rajaa, Jasim Mohammed, IoT-Driven Physical Training and Fitness Management in Colleges, (2024); International Academic Journal of Science and Engineering, (2024); J Knowl Econ, (2024); A., Hybrid Dy-NFIS & RLS equalization for ZCC code in optical-CDMA over multi-mode optical fiber, Periodicals of Engineering and Natural Sciences, 9, 1, pp. 253-276, (2021); Y., Internet of things driven physical activity recognition system for physical education, Microprocessors and Microsystems, 81, (2021); S., A two-level approach to characterizing human activities from wearable sensor data, Journal of Wireless Mobile Networks, Ubiquitous Computing, and Dependable Applications, 7, 3, pp. 1-21, (2016)","A.

These technologies, which range from wearable devices to digital mental health screenings, offer new opportunities for enhancing student well-being and strengthening support systems. Numerous studies have explored the ethical, legal, and social issues (ELSIs) of healthtech in the field of psychiatry, highlighting its potential benefits while also acknowledging the inherent complexities and risks that demand careful consideration. However, the ELSIs related to the use of healthtech in educational settings remain largely overlooked and insufficiently addressed. This study provides an overview of items that should be considered by researchers, teachers, and education boards or committees to promote healthtech in the educational context. By adapting existing ELSI frameworks from educational technology and digital health, this study systematically reviews ethical concerns surrounding healthtech in schools. Expert consultations were conducted through a project consisting of members with expertise related to healthtech, including developers, a teacher, a school counselor, and university researchers, leading to the identification of 52 ELSI concerns categorized into 8 domains: consent, rights and privacy, algorithms, information management, evaluation, use, role of public institutions, and relationships with private companies. Using Japan as a case study, we examine regulatory and cultural factors affecting healthtech adoption in schools. The findings reveal critical challenges, such as ensuring informed consent for minors, protecting student privacy, preventing biased algorithmic decision-making, and maintaining transparency in data management. In addition, institutional factors, including the role of public education policies and private-sector involvement, shape the ethical landscape of healthtech implementation. This study highlights the need for multistakeholder collaboration to establish guidelines that balance innovation with ethical responsibility. The study underscores the need for a multifaceted approach to mitigate risks such as data misuse, inequitable access, and algorithmic bias, ensuring the ethical and effective use of healthtech in education. The fundamental ELSI framework for healthtech, including privacy, consent, and algorithms, can be applied to educational systems worldwide, while aspects related to public education policies should be considered in accordance with the specific context of each country and culture. Incorporating healthtech into the educational system helps address the barriers associated with traditional approaches, including limited resources, cost constraints, and logistical challenges. Researchers from universities and healthtech companies, along with educators and other stakeholders, should ensure that healthtech projects consider diverse ELSI concerns at every stage before and during implementation. ©Motofumi Sumiya, Tomoko Nishimura, Kyoko Aizaki, Ikue Hirata, Nobuaki Tsukui, Yuko Osuka, Manabu Wakuta, Atsushi Senju.","education; ethical, legal, and social issues; health technology; school; well-being","","","","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS, (24K05786); Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development, AMED, (23gn0110071h0001); JST-Mirai Program, (23-221037845)","This work was supported by a JSPS KAKENHI grant (24K05786) to TN, the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED, Japan) grant (23gn0110071h0001) to TN and MW, and a JST-Mirai Program grant (23-221037845).","W.W., Effect of wearable activity trackers on physical activity in children and adolescents: a systematic review and meta-analysis, The Lancet Digital Health, 6, 9, pp. e625-e639, (2024); W., Promoting child and adolescent health through wearable technology: A systematic review, Digital Health, 10, (2024); T., Early detection of students’ mental health issues from a traditional daily health observation scheme in Japanese schools and its digitalization, Frontiers in Public Health, 12, (2024); A., The impact of the newly developed school-based ‘Digital Health Contact’—Evaluating a health and wellbeing screening tool for adolescents in England, PLOS ONE, 19, 1 January, (2024); E., Feasibility of School-Based Identification of Children and Adolescents Experiencing, or At-risk of Developing, Mental Health Difficulties: a Systematic Review, Prevention Science, 21, 5, pp. 581-603, (2020); M.D., Mental health screening in schools, Journal of School Health, 77, 2, pp. 53-58, (2007); N., Exploring the potential of a school-based online health and wellbeing screening tool: professional stakeholders’ perspectives and experiences, BMC Public Health, 22, 1, (2022); N., Exploring the Potential of a School-Based Online Health and Wellbeing Screening Tool: Young People’s Perspectives, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 19, 7, (2022); R.B., Lessons Learned: Beta-Testing the Digital Health Checklist for Researchers Prompts a Call to Action by Behavioral Scientists, Journal of Medical Internet Research, 23, 12, (2021); Nam Perspectives, (2019)","A.

This narrative review explores the applications and ethical considerations of AI technologies, including machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing, in key areas of men’s health such as fertility, erectile dysfunction, Peyronie’s disease, testosterone deficiency, and premature ejaculation. In reproductive medicine AI improves sperm morphology assessment, embryo selection, and prediction of seminal quality, offering more objective and accurate alternatives to traditional methods. For erectile dysfunction, AI supports diagnosis through advanced imaging, wearable sensors, and predictive modeling, while also contributing to drug discovery. In the context of Peyronie’s disease, AI enhances curvature assessment and three-dimensional modeling, improving diagnostic precision and surgical planning. AI also holds promise in improving the evaluation of testosterone deficiency by optimizing symptom questionnaires. Furthermore, AI-powered chatbots are emerging as accessible tools for patient education across various men’s health topics, including pre-consultation support for conditions such as premature ejaculation and vasectomy counseling. Despite AI’s advancements in men’s health, challenges remain in ensuring ethical implementation, protecting data privacy, patient autonomy, and promoting algorithm transparency. This review highlights the transformative potential of AI in the future of men’s health while emphasizing the importance of responsible integration guided by clinical validation, regulatory oversight, and adherence to ethical principles. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2025.","","algorithm; androgen deficiency; artificial intelligence; chatbot; consultation; data privacy; deep learning; diagnosis; diagnostic accuracy; drug therapy; embryo; erectile dysfunction; human; machine learning; men's health; natural language processing; patient autonomy; patient education; Peyronie disease; prediction; predictive model; premature ejaculation; questionnaire; review; sperm quality; therapy; total quality management; vasectomy; wearable sensor","","","","","","","Future Healthc J, (2021); Uro, (2024); E., Can AI chatbots accurately answer patient questions regarding vasectomies?, International Journal of Impotence Research, (2024); S., Assessing ChatGPT's ability to answer questions pertaining to erectile dysfunction: can our patients trust it?, International Journal of Impotence Research, 36, 7, pp. 734-740, (2024); I.H., Machine Learning: Algorithms, Real-World Applications and Research Directions, SN Computer Science, 2, 3, (2021); A., Automation of human semen analysis using a novel artificial intelligence optical microscopic technology, Andrologia, 51, 11, (2019); M., Artificial intelligence (Ai) in urology-current use and future directions: An itrue study, Turkish Journal of Urology, 46, pp. S27-S39, (2020); S., Explainable artificial intelligence to identify follicles that optimize clinical outcomes during assisted conception, Nature Communications, 16, 1, (2025); A., Towards a gamete matching platform: using immunogenetics and artificial intelligence to predict recurrent miscarriage, npj Digital Medicine, 2, 1, (2019); V.F.S., Web- And artificial intelligence–based image recognition for sperm motility analysis: Verification study, JMIR Medical Informatics, 8, 11, (2020)","H.

Our project addresses this gap by developing a real-time predictive engine to better understand students’ learning states, enabling more active learning and adaptive teaching in online settings. This engine leverages a combination of digital tools to predict cognitive load and engagement in real-time. In this work, we outline the procedures and some preliminary findings from developing and testing this predictive model using data from wearables and webcams. These devices captured physiological signals, facial expressions, eye gazes, and head poses to measure engagement levels in content-heavy classrooms. To build the model, we manually selected and extracted features from a pre-existing database containing sensory data. The model categorized students into two engagement levels: low and high. Following model development, we conducted an experimental study involving two 30-minute machine learning (ML) lectures with 12 college students. Alongside physiological data, self-reported survey data on engagement were collected as the ground truth. The engagement levels predicted by the engine were found to be highly associated with their self-reports on engagement (approximately 50% of variance shared). Results demonstrated that electrodermal activity (EDA), recorded via E4 wearable devices, was higher during challenging lecture segments than in easier ones. Additionally, variability in EDA levels during lectures correlated with self-reported stress, suggesting a potential link between stress and engagement. Through this work, we present insights into developing multimodal learning analytics based on real-time psychophysiological signals and learning behavioral data. These insights highlight the potential for integrating wearable and webcam data to enhance online learning. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.","Learning analytics; Machine learning; Online learning; Psychophysiology; Sensors; Student Engagement","Behavioral research; Computer aided instruction; Digital devices; E-learning; Learning systems; Machine learning; Physiological models; Students; Teaching; Wearable technology; Active Learning; Electrodermal activity; Engagement levels; Learning analytic; Machine-learning; Online learning; Online learning environment; Real- time; Student engagement; Student learning; Psychophysiology","","","","","","","E., Lernanto: Using an ambient display during differentiated instruction, Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings, 07-12-May-2016, pp. 2334-2340, (2016); R.P., Tools Designed to Support Self-Regulated Learning in Online Learning Environments: A Systematic Review, IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies, 15, 4, pp. 508-522, (2022); P., Unobtrusively enhancing reflection-in-action of teachers through spatially distributed ambient information, Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings, (2019); P., The TA Framework: Designing Real-time Teaching Augmentation for K-12 Classrooms, Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings, (2020); I., Emotion sensors go to school, Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications, 200, 1, pp. 17-24, (2009); T., OpenFace: An open source facial behavior analysis toolkit, (2016); N., Using video to automatically detect learner affect in computer-enabled classrooms, ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems, 6, 2, (2016); Handbook of Psychophysiology, (2007); Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive Mobile Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies, (2018); P., What the Face Reveals: Basic and Applied Studies of Spontaneous Expression Using the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), pp. 1-672, (2012)","L.

Working with computers at the wrong viewing angle and distance can cause neck strain and eye-related deficiency syndrome. The proposed system will solve this problem by designing and developing a sensor-based posture recognition system (SPRS). The system has base components like the ESP32, HC-SR04—an ultrasonic sensor—and MPU6050—an inertial measurement unit sensor (IMU). The system will continuously monitor the viewing screen distance from the computer to the person working with the computer and the viewing angle of that person concerning the screen. The optimal value for maintaining viewing distance is 50 to 70 cm, and the viewing angle is 15 to 30 degrees. The outcome of the proposed work confirms that the system constantly tracks the angle and distance obtained from the sensors and provides alarming feedback to the users whenever the tracked values are not at the optimal level. In the future, the system will be developed without using any wearable sensor, which will give more convenience to the user. The proposed system will include machine learning concepts to classify the different sitting posture styles. © 2025 by ASME.","Ergonomic; ESP32 microcontroller; Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensor; Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs); posture monitoring system; ultrasonic sensor; viewing angles","Diseases; Engineering education; Feedback control; Learning systems; Wearable sensors; ESP32 microcontroller; Inertial measurement unit sensor; Inertial measurements units; Monitoring system; Musculoskeletal disorder; Musculoskeletal disorders; Posture monitoring system; Sitting posture; Viewing angle; Viewing distance; Ergonomics","","","","","","","Advances in Industrial Ergonomics and Safety IV, (2002); P., Risk factors for musculoskeletal disorders among computer users, Occupational Medicine - State of the Art Reviews, 14, 1, pp. 17-38, (1999); B., Video display terminal workstation improvement program: I.

These injuries, ranging from minor sprains to stress fractures, can significantly impact student health and disrupt the learning process. Focused on addressing this issue, applying predictive analytics along with machine learning models to figure out the possible at-risk group of students timely interventions are set in motion by this study regarding the possibility to predict and potentially prevent injuries based on machine learning algorithms. Comprehensive datasets containing a combination of all demographic information related to physical and other metrics; injury history information; and detailed activity data reported from wearable equipment will be provided. Models that were applied to achieve this end are Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Results obtained from this indicate that the RNN model is the strongest one compared to others regarding accuracy since it identified the widest range of injury types with a very minor error. Random Forest also did quite well, whereas SVM and ANN showed lower accuracies, mostly while predicting complex injuries. Hence, the general results indicate that machine learning via real-time data analysis from wearables can significantly enhance injury prevention practices in PE. This approach provides educators and coaches with early warnings regarding the potential injury risks, allowing them to undertake preventive measures in improving both safety among students and athletic performance. © 2025 IEEE.","injury prevention; machine learning; physical education; predictive analytics; wearable devices","Prediction models; Support vector machines; Teaching; High school students; Injury prevention; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Neural-networks; Number of injuries; Physical education; Random forests; Support vectors machine; Wearable devices; Students","","","","","","","Y., Comparison of machine learning algorithms to predict intentional and unintentional poisoning risk factors, Heliyon, 9, 6, (2023); F., Evalution of neurodiagnostic insights for enhanced evaluation and optimization of badminton players' physical function via data mining technique, SLAS Technology, 29, 4, (2024); F.F., A System to Classify Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease using Pre-trained-Densenet201 with TSA, Measurement: Sensors, 33, (2024); J., Deep Learning Approach for Hand Drawn Emoji Identification, (2022); J., Designing Smart Grid and Irrigation Management Systems for Information Sharing for Enhanced Efficiency and Sustainability, pp. 532-537, (2023); J., An Integrated Machine Learning and IoT Based Approach for Enhanced Healthcare Efficiency and Personalized Treatment, Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems, 1046 LNNS, pp. 143-153, (2024); Y., Advancements in Brain Tumor Detection using Machine Learning Applications from MRI Image Analysis, pp. 809-814, (2023); Y., Machine learning to predict sports-related concussion recovery using clinical data, Annals of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine, 65, 4, (2022); J., Ranks aggregation and semantic genetic approach based hybrid model for query expansion, International Journal of Computational Intelligence Systems, 10, 1, pp. 34-55, (2017); J., IoT-Enhanced Agricultural Water Management System Utilizing Conventional Machine Learning Methods, pp. 554-559, (2023)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","3rd International Conference on Disruptive Technologies, ICDT 2025","2025-03-07 through 2025-03-08","Greater Noida","208865","","9798331519582","","","English","ICDT - Int.

Secondary and primary institutions are hesitant to employ these technologies. By providing individualized education encounters catered to each student's requirements, machine learning (ML) based adaptive learning platforms have revolutionized learning by increasing student involvement and results. Physical training can now be communicated through technology via the growth of the Internet of Things (IoT), which links affordable, diverse gadgets and sensors to open, public spaces. This research investigates the relationship between curriculum adjustment, a crucial aspect of sports, and physical activities using a decision tree. This platform gathers vital statistics from IoT-based wearable sensors, and by virtualization of the gadget, it interacts with the statistics in real time. Implementing and promoting physical education and learning curriculum in the real world and building healthier atmosphere platforms to address the health surveillance problems brought on by IoT sensors are the solutions suggested by the empirical evaluation. Research results demonstrate the remarkable physical activity surveillance accomplished by the suggested approach in comparison to the traditional technologies. With excellent accuracy ratios (98.5%), estimation ratios (96.6%), communication ratios (94.5%), functioning ratios (95.3%), effectiveness ratios (93.4), F-values (92.3%), and lower error rates (17.6%), the computational evaluation of physical education curriculum can assist learners and enhance the related facets of their physical skills. © 2025 IEEE.","Adaptive learning; and Internet of things; Curriculum adjustment; Machine learning; Physical education","Adversarial machine learning; Curricula; Federated learning; Self-supervised learning; Students; Teaching; Wearable sensors; Adaptive learning; Adaptive learning systems; And internet of thing; Curriculum adjustment; Learning platform; Learning statistics; Machine-learning; Physical activity; Physical education; Students' requirements; Contrastive Learning","","","","","","","S., When adaptive learning is effective learning: comparison of an adaptive learning system to teacher-led instruction, Interactive Learning Environments, 31, 2, pp. 793-803, (2023); H., Development and adoption of an adaptive learning system reflections and lessons learned, pp. 58-64, (2020); W., State of the art and practice in AI in education, European Journal of Education, 57, 4, pp. 542-570, (2022); Al-Emran, Mostafa, A Survey of Internet of Things (IoT) in Education: Opportunities and Challenges, Studies in Computational Intelligence, 846, pp. 197-209, (2020); A., Increasing Role of IoT in Education Sector: A Review of Internet of Educational Things (IoEdT), (2021); Educational Administration Theory and Practice, (2024); Evaluation Studies in Social Sciences, (2021); Educational Administration Theory and Practice, (2024); P., The Impact of Typical School Provision of Physical Education, Physical Activity and Sports on Adolescent Mental Health and Wellbeing: A Systematic Literature Review, Adolescent Research Review, 9, 2, pp. 339-364, (2024); R., A Circumplex Approach to (de)motivating Styles in Physical Education: Situations-In-School–Physical Education Questionnaire in Spanish Students, Pre-Service, and In-Service Teachers, Measurement in Physical Education and Exercise Science, 28, 1, pp. 86-108, (2024)","M.

Monitoring swimmers can aid in the development and participation of swimming sport. However, due to the difficulty of in-water monitoring, the existing methods in tool box are still limited. In this paper, a more accessible wearable monitoring system based on a flexible piezoelectric device is developed. This system collects muscle contracting and relaxing information by measuring its generated force on a Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) sensor. Then the information is transmitted via a low-frequency radio frequency (RF) signal to the receiver on land. This information is analyzed using a convolutional neural network and the classification of different strokes is realized. The system also supports monitoring at two positions by wearing multiple devices on the body. By integrating data from multiple positions, the analysis algorithm achieves a higher prediction accuracy of over 95%.

Here, we explore how innovative technologies can support Africa in addressing NTDs amidst such instability, through analysis of WHO and UNHCR data and a systematic literature review. Countries in Africa facing sociopolitical instability also bear a high burden of NTDs, with the continent ranking second globally in NTD burden (33%, 578 million people) and first in internal displacement (50%, 31.6 million people) in 2023. Studies have investigated technologies for their potential in NTD prevention, surveillance, diagnosis, treatment and management. Integrating the evidence, we discuss nine promising technologies—artificial intelligence, drones, mobile clinics, nanotechnology, telemedicine, augmented reality, advanced point-of-care diagnostics, mobile health Apps, and wearable sensors—that could enhance Africa’s response to NTDs in the face of persistent sociopolitical instability. As stability returns, these technologies will evolve to support more comprehensive and sustainable health development. The global health community should facilitate deployment of health technologies to those in greatest need to help achieve the NTD 2030 Roadmap and other global health targets. © The Author(s) 2024.","","artificial intelligence; displacement; education policy; health care; health policy; instability; literature review; Article; augmented reality; Buruli ulcer; chikungunya; coinfection; cutaneous leishmaniasis; Democratic Republic Congo; drone; echinococcosis; field hospital; global health; helminthiasis; human; intelligence; left ventricular systolic dysfunction; leishmaniasis; leprosy; literature; liver hydatid cyst; Mozambique; nanotechnology; neglected tropical disease; nonhuman; onchocerciasis; prevalence; prevention; schistosomiasis; secondary analysis; technology; telemedicine; trachoma; tropical disease; trypanosomiasis; United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees; visceral leishmaniasis; Africa; epidemiology; neglected disease; politics; prevention and control; procedures; tropical medicine; Artificial Intelligence; Humans; Neglected Diseases; Politics; Telemedicine; Tropical Medicine","","","","","National Institute for Health and Care Research, NIHR, (131996); National Institute for Health and Care Research, NIHR","The work was supported by the UK National Institute for Health and Care Research (Global Health Research 131996).

Factors known to be associated with cognition that can be gathered from accelerometers, user interfaces, and other sensors within wearable devices could be used to train machine learning models and develop wearable-based cognitive monitoring systems. Using data from over 2400 older adults in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) we developed prediction models to differentiate older adults with normal cognition from those with poor cognition based on outcomes from three cognitive tests measuring different domains of cognitive function. During repeated cross-validation CatBoost, XGBoost, and Random Forest models performed best when predicting poor cognition based on tests measuring processing speed, working memory, and attention (median AUCs ≥0.82) compared to immediate and delayed recall (median AUCs ≥0.72) and categorical verbal fluency (median AUC ≥ 0.68). Activity and sleep parameters were also more strongly associated with poor cognition based on tests assessing processing speed, working memory, and attention compared to other cognitive subdomains. Our work provides proof of concept that data collatable through wearable devices such as age, education, sleep parameters, activity summaries, and light exposure metrics could be used to differentiate between older adults with normal versus poor cognition. We further identified metrics that could be targets in future causal studies seeking to better understand how sleep and activity parameters influence cognitive function among older adults. © The Author(s) 2024.","","","","","","","Innovation and Technology Commission - Hong Kong; City University of Hong Kong, CityU, (9610473, 7005892); City University of Hong Kong, CityU","This study was supported by City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China internal research grant #9610473 and #7005892 and the Hong Kong Innovation and Technology Commission (InnoHK Project CIMDA).

It adopted a quantitative survey method, using primary data from 374 young tennis players. The model fitness was evaluated using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), while the hypotheses were evaluated using structural equation modeling (SEM). The model fitness was confirmed through CFA, demonstrating high fit indices: CFI = 0.924, TLI = 0.913, IFI = 0.924, RMSEA = 0.057, and SRMR = 0.041, indicating a robust model fit. Hypotheses testing revealed that physical training frequency (β = 0.198, p = 0.000), AI-powered coaching systems (β = 0.349, p = 0.000), virtual reality training environments (β = 0.476, p = 0.000), and wearable sensors (β = 0.171, p = 0.000) significantly influenced technical skills acquisition. In contrast, the weekly training plan (β = 0.024, p = 0.834) and personalized learning (β = -0.045, p = 0.81) did not have a significant effect. Mediation analysis revealed that personalized learning was not a significant mediator between training methods/technologies and acquiring technical abilities. The results revealed that physical training frequency, AI-powered coaching systems, virtual reality training environments, and wearable sensors significantly influenced technical skills acquisition. However, personalized learning did not have a significant mediation effect. The study recommended that young tennis players' organizations and stakeholders consider investing in emerging technologies and training methods. Effective training should be given to coaches on effectively integrating emerging technologies into coaching regimens and practices. © 2024 Liu et al.","","titanium; adolescent; adult; article; Article; artificial intelligence; athlete; burnout; child; confirmatory factor analysis; demographics; educational status; female; finite element analysis; fitness; heart rate; human; kinematics; learning; Likert scale; literature; machine learning; major clinical study; male; marriage; mediation analysis; osseointegration; phonetics; physical activity; physical performance; questionnaire; resistance training; scanning electron microscopy; scoring system; skill; sport injury; stomach cancer; structural equation modeling; structured questionnaire; tennis; traffic accident; training; treadmill exercise; virtual reality; young adult; athletic performance; education; physiology; wearable computer; Adolescent; Athletic Performance; Child; Female; Humans; Learning; Male; Tennis; Virtual Reality; Wearable Electronic Devices","","titanium, 7440-32-6","","","","","N.S., Technical and tactical skills related to performance levels in tennis: A systematic review, Journal of Sports Sciences, 37, 1, pp. 108-121, (2019); N.S., Technical skills in complex tennis situations: Dutch talented players U15 compared to players U17, Frontiers in Sports and Active Living, 5, (2023); Top Tennis Skills all Beginners Need to Master, (2024); W., Basic principles regarding strength, flexibility, and stability exercises, PM and R, 4, 11, pp. 805-811, (2012); M., Strength and conditioning in tennis: Current research and practice, Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport, 11, 3, pp. 248-256, (2008); Y., Effects of high-intensity interval training on strength, speed, and endurance performance among racket sports players: A systematic review, PLOS ONE, 19, 1 January, (2024); J.M., The effects of training with loads that maximise power output and individualised repetitions vs. traditional power training, PLOS ONE, 12, 10, (2017); X., Effects of high-intensity functional training on physical fitness and sport-specific performance among the athletes: A systematic review with meta-analysis, PLOS ONE, 18, 12 December, (2023); M., The Effect on Flexibility and a Variety of Performance Tests of the Addition of 4 Weeks of Soleus Stretching to a Regular Dynamic Stretching Routine in Amateur Female Soccer Players, Sports, 11, 7, (2023); W., Effects of a 6-Week Agility Training Program on Emotional Intelligence and Attention Levels in Adolescent Tennis Players, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 14, 3, (2024)","Y.

However, the widespread adoption of augmented-reality (AR) displays has been limited due to the bulky projection optics of their light engines and their inability to accurately portray three-dimensional (3D) depth cues for virtual content, among other factors4,5. Here we introduce a holographic AR system that overcomes these challenges using a unique combination of inverse-designed full-colour metasurface gratings, a compact dispersion-compensating waveguide geometry and artificial-intelligence-driven holography algorithms. These elements are co-designed to eliminate the need for bulky collimation optics between the spatial light modulator and the waveguide and to present vibrant, full-colour, 3D AR content in a compact device form factor. To deliver unprecedented visual quality with our prototype, we develop an innovative image formation model that combines a physically accurate waveguide model with learned components that are automatically calibrated using camera feedback. Our unique co-design of a nanophotonic metasurface waveguide and artificial-intelligence-driven holographic algorithms represents a significant advancement in creating visually compelling 3D AR experiences in a compact wearable device. © The Author(s) 2024.","","glass; poly(methyl methacrylate); algorithm; artificial intelligence; digitization; holography; three-dimensional modeling; virtual reality; Article; augmented reality; convolutional neural network; electromagnetism; Full-colour 3D holography; geometry; information processing; mathematical model; metasurface waveguides; scanning electron microscopy; simulation; three-dimensional imaging; calibration; color; devices; human; procedures; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Augmented Reality; Calibration; Color; Holography; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional","","poly(methyl methacrylate), 39320-98-4, 9008-29-1","SF6 glass, Schott","Schott","National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF; Samsung; Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF; Ministry of Education, MOE, (2022R1A6A3A03073823); Ministry of Education, MOE; Army Research Office, ARO, (W911NF-19-1-0120); Army Research Office, ARO; School Nutrition Foundation, SNF, (ECCS-2026822); School Nutrition Foundation, SNF; National Science Foundation, NSF, (2026822); National Science Foundation, NSF","M.G. is supported by a Stanford Graduate Fellowship in Science and Engineering.

The tools used to assess students’ attention have also developed beyond the traditional methods used by teachers in the classroom, which have been based solely on observing the expressions and movementsof students. During the recent home quarantines related to COVID-19, educational institutions have been pushed to move more rapidly to e-learning, despite this unconventional approach remaining subject to intense debate and polemic, increasing the need to integrate it into the educational process. The resulting learning process is thus widely affected by the development of Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things techniques, as well as being dependent on the ubiquity of information technology that has become a primary part of modern life. In online only, or even mixed, education, traditional methods of determining the extent of student attention do not work. The Internet of Things, communication technologies, smart controllers, and sensors have thus begun to be used, alongside electroencephalogram (EEG) sensors to examine users’ brains and to determine their mental state based on activity signals, along with eye movements and head inclinations as recorded by a laptop camera or similar device. Heartbeat may also be monitored using a small wearable device. In this research, several research studies on the subject of determining student attention are thus reviewed as a way to identify techniques that can be used to enable teachers to ascertain the degree of student attention receivedduring e-learning tofacilitate the emergence of alerts for students and teachers as necessary. © 2024 American Institute of Physics Inc..

Life jackets serve as a crucial safety measure in underwater environments. Nonetheless, most conventional life jackets lack the capability to monitor the wearer's underwater body movements, impeding their effectiveness in rescue operations. Here, we present an intelligent self-powered life jacket system (SPLJ) composed of a wireless body area sensing network, a set of deep learning analytics, and a human condition detection platform. Six coaxial core-shell structure triboelectric fiber sensors with high sensitivity, stretchability, and flexibility are integrated into this system. Additionally, a portable integrated circuit module is incorporated into the SPLJ to facilitate real-time monitoring of the wearer's movement. Moreover, by leveraging the deep-learning-assisted data analytics and establishing a robust correlation between the wearer's movements and condition, we have developed a comprehensive system for monitoring drowning individuals, achieving an outstanding recognition accuracy of 100%. This groundbreaking work introduces a fresh approach to underwater intelligent survival devices, offering promising prospects for advancing underwater smart wearable devices in rescue operations and the development of ocean industry.

Utilizing three distinct approaches—a linear regression model based on the Vertical Average Loading Rate (VALR), a physics-based method, and a sophisticated ML algorithm—this research was conducted with 10 participants equipped with wearable sensors. The results revealed the ML model's superior performance over both the physics-based and VALR techniques, achieving Mean Absolute Percentage Errors (MAPEs) of 6.7 percent and 11.3 percent respectively. This was accomplished through extensive training across various datasets. Additionally, the ML approach demonstrated remarkable reliability in 25 different running session simulations, underscoring its effectiveness in complex musculoskeletal analytics. These findings not only highlight the potential of ML in enhancing wearable technology for biomechanical data analysis but also emphasize the necessity for further comprehensive studies in this field. © 2024 The Authors","Biomechanical data; Health technology; Machine learning; Musculoskeletal analysis; Real-time monitoring; Tibial bone force; Wearable sensors","Biomechanics; Engineering education; Linear regression; Machine learning; Musculoskeletal system; Biomechanical data; Force monitoring; Health technology; Loading rate; Machine-learning; Musculoskeletal analyse; Real time monitoring; Real- time; Sensor technologies; Tibial bone force; Wearable sensors","","","","","","","L., Activity recognition from user-annotated acceleration data, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 3001, pp. 1-17, (2004); A., A tutorial on human activity recognition using body-worn inertial sensors, ACM Computing Surveys, 46, 3, (2014); L., A knowledge-driven approach to activity recognition in smart homes, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 24, 6, pp. 961-974, (2012); ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter, (2011); Y., A Wearable Transient Pressure Sensor Made with MXene Nanosheets for Sensitive Broad-Range Human-Machine Interfacing, Nano Letters, 19, 2, pp. 1143-1150, (2019); J., Flexible, Tunable, and Ultrasensitive Capacitive Pressure Sensor with Microconformal Graphene Electrodes, ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces, 11, 16, pp. 14997-15006, (2019); Y., Wearable Strain Sensor Based on Double-Layer Graphene Fabrics for Real-Time, Continuous Acquirement of Human Pulse Signal in Daily Activities, Advanced Materials Technologies, 6, 5, (2021); W., Emerging wearable flexible sensors for sweat analysis, Bio-Design and Manufacturing, 5, 1, pp. 64-84, (2022); Y., Flexible Hybrid Sensors for Health Monitoring: Materials and Mechanisms to Render Wearability, Advanced Materials, 32, 15, (2020); Cureus, (2023)","S.

The availability of low-cost sensors and affordable computational power allows researchers to investigate different modes of group work. However, the field faces challenges stemming from the complexity and specialization of the systems required for capturing diverse interaction modalities, with commercial systems often being expensive or narrow in scope and researcher-developed systems needing to be more specialized and difficult to deploy. Therefore, more user-friendly, adaptable, affordable, open-source, and easy-to-deploy systems are needed to advance research and application in the MMLA field. The paper presents a field report on the design of mBox that aims to support group work across different contexts. We share the progress of mBox, a low-cost, easy-to-use platform grounded on learning theories to investigate collaborative learning settings.

Therefore, deep learning using electrocardiogram (ECG) signals is being developed as a next-generation user-recognition technology for application in real-life environments based on high security and accuracy. This study proposes a deep learning model that combines multilayered explainable artificial intelligence for user recognition in a real-life environment. The ECG-signal database utilizes the MIT-BIH normal sinus rhythm database (NSRDB) and a self-acquired database. A comparison between a single deep learning model and the proposed multilayer deep learning model using these signals confirmed that the proposed model achieved higher accuracy, with minimum accuracy differences of 15% and 0.2%. In addition, the recognition accuracies of the single deep learning model and multilayered deep learning model were compared five times to confirm the difference in output results caused by various factors in the single deep learning model. The user-recognition accuracies of a single deep learning model for the NSRDB exhibited a difference of 3.4%, whereas those of the multilayered model showed a difference of 0.9%. The user-recognition accuracy difference when applying the self-acquired database to the single deep learning model was 1.3%, but that of the multilayered deep learning model was 0.3%. Therefore, the multilayered deep learning model exhibited a stable user-recognition accuracy compared to that of the single structure, and the optimized area that affects the output result was confirmed. © 2014 IEEE.","Electrocardiogram (ECG); empirical mode decomposition (EMD); explainable artificial intelligence (XAI); multilayered convolutional neural network (CNN); user recognition","Biological systems; Database systems; Deep learning; Electrocardiography; Engineering education; Wearable technology; Biological system modeling; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Explainable artificial intelligence; Features extraction; Learning models; Multi-layered; Multilayered CNN; Recognition accuracy; User recognition; Empirical mode decomposition","","","","","","","M., Smart Wearables for the Detection of Cardiovascular Diseases: A Systematic Literature Review, Sensors, 23, 2, (2023); M.R., On using cognitive models in cryptography, Proceedings - International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications, AINA, 2016-May, pp. 1055-1058, (2016); Understanding the Ekg Signal, (2023); D., DARPA's explainable artificial intelligence program, AI Magazine, 40, 2, pp. 44-58, (2019); A., Peeking Inside the Black-Box: A Survey on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), IEEE Access, 6, pp. 52138-52160, (2018); M.-G., Deep Learning Based on 1-D Ensemble Networks Using ECG for Real-Time User Recognition, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, 15, 10, pp. 5656-5663, (2019); S.J., ECG Authentication System Design Based on Signal Analysis in Mobile and Wearable Devices, IEEE Signal Processing Letters, 23, 6, pp. 805-808, (2016); T., Optimised band-pass filter to ensure accurate ECG-based identification of exercising human subjects, Electronics Letters, 53, 4, pp. 222-224, (2017); S., Real-Time Patient-Specific ECG Classification by 1-D Convolutional Neural Networks, IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering, 63, 3, pp. 664-675, (2016); Cardiologist Level Arrhythmia Detection with Convolutional Neural Networks, (2017)","J.

In this context, children use movement as a social tool, resulting in distinctive proximity patterns in space and synchrony with others over time. However, the social implications of children's movements with peers in space and time are difficult to determine due to the difficulty of acquiring reliable data during natural interactions. In this article, we review research demonstrating that proximity and synchrony are important indicators of affiliation among preschoolers and highlight challenges in this line of research. We then argue for the advantages of using wearable sensor technology and machine learning analytics to quantify social movement.

Data-intensive research fields that require extensive data analysis, such as Multimodal Learning Analytics, rely on data collected through various sensory devices, such as wearable devices or visual sensors. Depending on the type of sensor used, the data collected may contain personal information about the users, such as full video recordings to examine their kinematic behaviour. This can become controversial due to ethical considerations and international regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation of the European Union. In this study, we propose using animations instead of videos to analyse multimodal data, such as learning analytics, in educational settings. Visual animations can preserve the participants’ privacy while maintaining the data analysis’s quality.

Measurements were taken by recording the face of the subjects and acquiring EEG signals from a wearable device. We explore the use of chaotic descriptors such as Lyapunov exponents, fractal dimension, Hurst exponent and approximate entropy to extract meaningful information from EEG signals. Subsequently we tested different machine learning algorithms to classify EEG signals and analyze the onset of critical thinking. An experiment was conducted in which students engaged in problem-based learning scenarios while wearing portable EEG devices. The collected data were then analyzed to discern patterns and discriminate between relevant, irrelevant, and false information in EEG signals. The experimental setup involved measuring the EEG signals from engineering students as they solved problem-based learning scenarios. The results demonstrated the ability to distinguish between different sections of a video based on brain activity, with false, relevant, and irrelevant information. Some findings include the left frontal electrode with the theta frequency band exhibiting the highest distinguishability for relevant information. From the experiments, we identified the Hurst exponent and approximated entropy as the most relevant descriptors for classification. The main contribution of this study is to offer an approach to decode critical thinking in engineering undergraduate students using EEG measurements and machine learning techniques. © 2024 IEEE.","Chaotic Descriptors; Critical Thinking; Educational Innovation; Electroencephalogram; Facial Emotion Recognition; Higher Education; Machine Learning","Biomedical signal processing; Brain; Emotion Recognition; Entropy; Face recognition; Fractal dimension; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Lyapunov methods; Machine learning; Speech recognition; Students; Chaotic descriptor; Chaotics; Critical thinking; Descriptors; Educational innovations; Emotion recognition; Facial emotion recognition; Facial emotions; High educations; Machine-learning; Electroencephalography","","","","","Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey, ITESM; (PHHT085-21ZZNV049)","The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support of Writing Lab, Institute for the Future of Education, Tecnologico de Monterrey, Mexico, in the production of this work.

However, detecting it early enough can possibly slow its continuous degeneration and lessen the toll on families and caregivers alike. Due to its mortality within 10 years of onset as well as its enormous socioeconomic burden, there have been active efforts by researchers to find smart and innovative solutions for its early detection, prediction, monitoring, and management. These efforts are driven by the recent advancements in the Internet of Things (IoT), wearable technologies, and machine learning algorithms. The solutions are modeled around the modifiable risk factors of dementia. In this study, we conducted a survey of smart solutions developed or implemented to assist caregivers and clinicians in managing the health of these affected individuals. We then looked at the issues and limitations of these solutions, and argued that integrated solutions comprising wearable and non-wearable technologies modeled around multiple risk factors of dementia are necessary and should be the direction of future studies. © 2024 The Authors.","activities of daily living (ADL); Alzheimer’s disease (AD); Dementia; elderly; Internet of Things (IoT); machine learning; non-wearable technology; wearable technology","Artificial intelligence; Engineering education; Internet of things; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Neurodegenerative diseases; Temperature sensors; Wearable sensors; Activities of Daily Living; Activity of daily living; Alzheimer; Alzheimers disease; Alzheimer’s disease; Biomedical monitoring; Dementia; Elderly; Intelligent sensors; Internet of thing; Machine-learning; Non-wearable technology; Non-wearables; Temperature measurement","","","","","Soonchunhyang University, SCH; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF; (RS-2022-00165681)","This work was supported by the Soonchunhyang University Research Fund.

Through wearable sensors and cameras, it is possible to monitor both the state of the physical world and the biometric status of a human operator, which can allow the AI to offer adaptive assistance tailored to match the user's needs and optimize aid. Developing AI models for such purposes requires training data that not only describes users' cognitive state during tasks but also accounts for their responses to the interactive system during the task. We introduce the Multi-Modal User Modeling for Task Guidance (MUMTG) to support the development of AI models for such purposes. The dataset is created through human-subjects studies with users performing search and assembly procedures with help from virtual instructions provided by either a head-worn AR headset or a monitor screen. The data-collection study uses a game-like scenario to guide participants through six guided tasks that vary in difficulty. Within each group, we manipulated task duration and induced several stress triggers to increase the task cognitive demand for three tasks. The dataset includes physiological data such as electrodermal activity, temperature, heart rate, pupil dilation, and gaze. We also collected subjective self-report ratings regarding task workload and emotional responses after each task. We offer this rich dataset as a valuable resource to facilitate the development of user models for task guidance in highly demanding contexts. © 2024 IEEE.","Computer-assisted instruction; Education; HCI design and evaluation methods; Human computer interaction (HCI); Human computer interaction (HCI); Human-centered computing; Interaction paradigms; Mixed / augmented reality; Human-centered computing; User studies; Applied computing","Computer aided instruction; E-learning; Human computer interaction; User interfaces; Virtual reality; Wearable computers; Applied computing; Computer Assisted Instruction; Design and evaluation methods; Human computer interaction design and evaluation method; Human-centered computing; Human-computer-interaction designs; Interaction design methods; Interaction evaluations; Interaction paradigm; Mixed / augmented reality;; User study; User study;; Augmented reality","","","","","Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA, (HR00112220005)","This work was supported in part by the DARPA Perceptually-enabled Task Guidance (PTG) Program under HR00112220005.","N.C., Cognitive performance of military men and women during prolonged load carriage, BMJ Military Health, 169, 1, pp. 37-45, (2022); B.B., Preface, pp. xix-xx, (2006); I.L., Frustration and the quality of performance: II.

Wearable devices, such as those for monitoring physiological signals, have rapidly developed and are now being applied in college and university evaluation. Due to the non-standard and unscientific practices in teaching, teachers may experience psychological obstacles when evaluating students. To ensure successful evaluation, we must motivate teachers to correctly understand and actively participate in the evaluation process, thus facilitating communication between people and computers. Emotion recognition based on multi-physiological signals, such as ECG, pulse, electromyography, electrodermal, and respiratory signals, is an effective method for achieving this. This dissertation conducts in-depth research on the methods for emotion recognition based on multi-physiological signals. It explores feature extraction methods, feature selection, and fusion to provide objective assessments of physiological and psychological activity states, which are used as a basis for accurate emotional judgments. © 2024 IGI Global.

The most frequently studied implementation of this technology concerns applications based on widespread mobile devices. These applications usually enrich the real world with virtual educational multimedia content that users can view, but not interact with. Wearable devices like AR glasses allow users to be better immersed in and more effectively interact with the virtual content since their hands are free for handling controllers or hand tracking. Nevertheless, relevant literature indicates that there is a limited amount of research on teachers’ experience when using interactive educational applications with wearable AR glasses. The aim of this study was to investigate teachers’ experience when using interactive educational applications with AR glasses. The sample consisted of 46 primary and secondary school teachers with previous experience in using mobile-based AR applications. The participants used three interactive applications on the Magic Leap 1 AR glasses for 40–45 min and were then asked to evaluate their levels of spatial presence, simulator sickness, usability, and workload. The results support that the use of educational interactive applications with AR glasses was a positive experience and that this is a promising technology for educational uses. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","AR Glasses; Augmented Reality; Educational Interactive Applications; Teachers; User Experience","Augmented reality; Educational technology; Interactive devices; Wearable computers; Augmented reality glass; Educational Applications; Educational interactive application; Emerging technologies; Interactive applications; Multimedia contents; Real-world; Teachers'; Users' experiences; Wearable devices; Glass","","","","","","","Computers Education, (2022); R.T., A survey of augmented reality, Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments, 6, 4, pp. 355-385, (1997); Akçayir, Murat, Advantages and challenges associated with augmented reality for education: A systematic review of the literature, Educational Research Review, 20, pp. 1-11, (2017); H.-K., Current status, opportunities and challenges of augmented reality in education, Computers and Education, 62, pp. 41-49, (2013); I., Augmented reality in education: A meta-review and cross-media analysis, Personal and Ubiquitous Computing, 18, 6, pp. 1533-1543, (2014); T., The Impact of an Augmented Reality Application on Learning Motivation of Students, Advances in Human-Computer Interaction, 2019, (2019); P.A., Behaviorism, cognitivism, constructivism: Comparing critical features from an instructional design perspective, Performance Improvement Quarterly, 26, 2, pp. 43-71, (2013); Proceedings of the 12th Annual International Workshop on Presence, (2009); Á., Impact of an augmented reality system on students' motivation for a visual art course, Computers and Education, 68, pp. 586-596, (2013); A., Simulator sickness in Augmented Reality training using the Microsoft HoloLens, Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings, 2018-April, (2018)","I.

It affect students' learning by impairing comprehension, diminishing academic achievement, impeding critical thinking, and encouraging a lack of attention and engagement in classroom activities. This study aims to introduce a new method of detecting and tracking mind wandering in university students. This approach involves using wearable sensors, including galvanic skin response (GSR), photoplethysmography (PPG), and eye-trackers, along with machine learning techniques. The study provides a proof of concept for this multisensory approach. The association between longer fixation duration and mind wandering, and the influence of an instructor's presence on fixation allocation, and, consequently, the frequency and occurrence of mind wandering is investigated. Furthermore, the feasibility of using eye-trackers in conjunction with GSR and PPG sensors for detecting mind wandering through a wearable multisensory data collection system is assessed. The wearable multisensory device is evaluated by ten participants (university students, males/females aged between 21-30). Two distinct machine learning methods, support vector machine (SVM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU), are used as classification models. With sensor fusion, the SVM and GRU models yielded maximum accuracies of 86.53% and 89.86%, respectively. Moreover, participants are observed to fixate on instructors more often, just before instances of mind wandering. © 2023 The Authors.

By leveraging advanced technologies such as wearable sensors, machine learning algorithms, and virtual reality (VR), AI enables real-time monitoring, personalized training program adjustments, and predictive injury prevention. For instance, AI-optimized high-intensity interval training (HIIT) improved athletes' VO<inf>2</inf> max by 14.3%, while machine learning-driven agility training enhanced directional transition efficiency by 2 4. 5%. Case studies from national teams in China, Japan, and Germany demonstrated the efficacy of AI in identifying biomechanical deficiencies and reducing injury risks by up to 34%. Despite challenges such as data privacy concerns and technical complexity, the study highlights AI's potential to revolutionize traditional training paradigms through precision, adaptability, and scientific rigor. The findings underscore the critical role of AI in advancing athletic performance, extending career longevity, and promoting interdisciplinary innovation in sports science. © 2024 IEEE.","AI physical fitness; high-level table tennis athletes; machine learning in sports science; personalized training","Data privacy; E-learning; Engineering education; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Personnel training; Sports medicine; Tennis; Wearable sensors; Artificial intelligence physical fitness; Fitness training; High-level table tennis athlete; Machine learning in sport science; Machine-learning; Personalized training; Physical fitness; Physical training; Sport science; Table-tennis; Learning systems","","","","","","","Phil Trans Roy Soc London, (1955); A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism, (1873); Magnetism, (1963); K., Societal Norms and Conditions and Their Influence on Daily Life in Children With Type 1 Diabetes in the West Bank in Palestine, Journal of Pediatric Nursing, 33, pp. 16-22, (2017); ACSM S Guidelines for Exercise Testing and Prescription, (2020); T., Electron Spectroscopy Studies on Magneto-Optical Media and Plastic Substrate Interface, 2, 8, pp. 740-741, (1987); Technical Writer S Handbook, (1989); P., Analysis of Electrical Characteristic of PVA / Zndust Ionic Membrane for the Application of Biomedical, (2024); S.K., The 3D Printing of Nanocomposites for Wearable Biosensors: Recent Advances, Challenges, and Prospects, Bioengineering, 11, 1, (2024); Health and Beauty, (2024)","T.

Much of MMLA takes place in experimental and laboratory settings, researching students' learning in in-between spaces—between research and classroom application, in-between students' learning in private and public spaces as researchers track students' learning both in their use of social media and connected devices, and through the use of context-aware and adaptive devices; and lastly, in-between respecting students' privacy while increasingly using intrusive technologies. This study seeks to establish what is known about MMLA in terms of rationale for applications, the nature and scope of data collected, the study contexts, evidence of commercial interests and/or downstream uses of students' data, and consideration of ethics, privacy, and the protection of student data. This systematic review analysed 192 articles using a search string consisting of various combinations of multimodal (data) and learning analytics. The main findings include, inter alia, that though MMLA provide insights into learning and teaching, there is little evidence of MMLA findings successfully being applied to classroom settings, at scale. Given that the nature of MMLA research often necessitates the use of a range of (intrusive) sensors and recording technologies and can include children in its samples; the encroachment of students' right to privacy is a huge concern that is not addressed. There is also a need to reconsider the rationale for collecting multimodal data, the conditions under which such data collection will be ethical and in service of students' wellness, and the boundaries that should protect their (multimodal) data. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Experimental educational research predates both multimodal learning analytics (MMLA) and educational data mining (EDM). MMLA has been an integral part of learning analytics as research focus and practice since its inception. The increased digitisation and datafication, advances in technology (eg, sensor technology, geo-tracking, etc.) and a growing normalisation of wearable technologies provides greater scope for collecting multimodal data. There is a vast body of published MMLA research providing a range of insight into students' and educators' behaviours aiming to increase the effectiveness of teaching. What this paper adds While there are several studies providing insights into the state of MMLA research, this study provides insight to a selected range of factors in MMLA research such as the type of research (empirical/conceptual); the nature and scope of data collected; the sample populations (pre-higher education, higher education, etc.); evidence of commercial interests or consideration of downstream uses; issues pertaining to consent, privacy, data protection and ethics; and evidence of how findings were used to improve teaching and learning. The vast majority of MMLA research targets higher education, is empirical in nature and is based on relatively small samples of participation in experimental settings. Confirms previous research that found the predominance of small samples, and a lack of replicability and, as a result, lacking scalability. That there is very little explicit discussion of the ethical and privacy implications and data protection, either at design stage or for future implementation. Similarly, that there is little consideration of potential commercial interests or downstream uses of data. Implications for practice and/or policy MMLA in its essence requires interdisciplinary approaches and teams. For MMLA to move beyond small-scale, experimental settings to application in real (classroom) settings, larger, replicable studies should be conducted together with ways to make study findings actionable for teachers and students. Ethical issues, commercial interests and downstream uses of collected data must be considered within the design and approval of MMLA research. © 2023 British Educational Research Association.","ethics; multimodal learning analytics; privacy; student data","Artificial intelligence; Data acquisition; Data mining; Data privacy; Engineering education; Ethical technology; Wearable sensors; Classroom settings; Down-stream; High educations; Multi-modal data; Multi-modal learning; Multimodal learning analytic; Privacy; Student data; Student learning; Systematic Review; Students","","","","","","","P.A., Methodological Guidance Paper: The Art and Science of Quality Systematic Reviews, Review of Educational Research, 90, 1, pp. 6-23, (2020); D., Learning Analytics’ Privacy in the Fog and Edge Computing: A Systematic Mapping Review, Lecture Notes in Educational Technology, pp. 1199-1207, (2023); M.-V., Learning Analytics for Knowledge Creation and Inventing in K-12: A Systematic Review, Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems, 508 LNNS, pp. 238-257, (2022); Data Gaze, (2019); D., The problem of researching a recursive society: Algorithms, data coils and the looping of the social, Big Data and Society, 9, 2, (2022); A.L., The use of learning analytics and the potential risk of harm for K-12 students participating in digital learning environments, Educational Technology Research and Development, 69, 1, pp. 327-330, (2021); P., Multimodal learning analytics, ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, pp. 102-106, (2013); W., A review on data fusion in multimodal learning analytics and educational data mining, Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, 12, 4, (2022); P., Efar-mmla: An evaluation framework to assess and report generalizability of machine learning models in mmla, Sensors, 21, 8, (2021); Cook, David Allan, Current concepts in validity and reliability for psychometric instruments: Theory and application, American Journal of Medicine, 119, 2, pp. 166-166.e16, (2006)","S.

The technical and scientific components that have permeated different sports sectors are becoming progressively less important as technology developments and the IoT requires disconnected. To address this problem, this study proposed a based deep learning technique for the tennis sports industry and the implications of smart athletes’ fitness using the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. The three basic categories of IoT-based smart fitness are player trackers, which include wearable and non-wearable sensors, movement analysis, and player applications. The skills and strategies of tennis players have improved through the use of sports products, and people have come to value physical education more as education has expanded. The development of a smart tennis system is meant to address the slow detection and unpredictable player and coaching staff movements of the traditional game of tennis. The background of the video is rebuilt using a median filter algorithm, and its target is located using an inter-frame difference technique to identify the track’s designated shoulder marker point. Using an enhanced SVM, it creates a tennis service model for evaluating and examining marker point tracks. The experimental results compare the proposed method with different machine learning methods such as decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), deep neural network (DNN), and recurrent neural network (RNN) algorithms. The classification achieved excellent performance by the player motions, and the SVM is better than the other deep learning.

Traditionally, students learn badminton through their instructor's physical demonstration, verbal instructions, and small group activities. To enhance students' learning experience and assist badminton instructors more effectively, this study proposes an alternative teaching approach that utilizes a Badminton Teaching-Assisted System (BTAS) to teach swing movements. The system uses a gesture control armband to collect electromyography and gyroscope signals from professional players, which are then used to build a machine learning model based on the back propagation neural network. The model can be used as a scoring tool to assess the correctness of the student's swing movements and muscle strength. A total of 87 students participated in an eleven-week experiment focusing on two fundamental badminton skills: The backhand push and backhand lift. The results demonstrated a significant improvement in the correctness of the muscle strength during swing movements for the experimental group, compared to the control group. The BTAS can help to enhance the effectiveness of badminton instruction, thereby improving students' swing techniques. Future research could expand upon this study to develop more precise artificial intelligence-based sports assistance systems, which would facilitate personalized teaching and learning in physical education. © 2008-2011 IEEE.","Artificial intelligence; computer-assisted instruction; devices for learning; sports; wearable computers and body area","Backpropagation; Computer aided instruction; E-learning; Electromyography; Gyroscopes; Neural networks; Sports; Students; Wearable sensors; Biomedical monitoring; Computer Assisted Instruction; Device for learning; Group activities; Learn+; Muscle strength; Student learning experiences; Teaching approaches; Verbal instructions; Wearable computer and body area; Muscle","","","","","Ministry of Education, MOE; National Science and Technology Council, NSTC, (MOST 109-2511-H-003-053-MY3, MOST 111-2410-H-003-028-MY3, NSTC 111-2410-H-110-034, PBM1110178); National Taiwan Normal University, NTNU","This work was supported in part by the National Science and Technology Council of Taiwan under Grant MOST 109-2511-H-003-053-MY3, Grant MOST 111-2410-H-003-028-MY3, Grant NSTC 111-2410-H-110-034, in part by MOE Teaching Practice Research Program under Grant PBM1110178, and in part by the ""Institute for Research Excellence in Learning Sciences"" of National Taiwan Normal University (NTNU) from The Featured Areas Research Center Program within the framework of the Higher Education Sprout Project by the Ministry of Education (MOE) in Taiwan.","S., The Future of Educational Technologies for Engineering Education, IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies, 14, 5, pp. 613-623, (2021); Prieto, Luis P., Multimodal teaching analytics: Automated extraction of orchestration graphs from wearable sensor data, Journal of Computer Assisted Learning, 34, 2, pp. 193-203, (2018); J.Y., Possibilities and implications of using a motion-tracking system in physical education, European Physical Education Review, 20, 4, pp. 444-464, (2014); T., Improvement of badminton-player tracking applying image pixel compensation, ITE Transactions on Media Technology and Applications, 5, 2, pp. 36-41, (2017); Fang, Lei, Motion recognition technology of badminton players in sports video images, Future Generation Computer Systems, 124, pp. 381-389, (2021); M., Can learning of basketball be enhanced through a web-based multimedia course?

Patients suffering from depression are less likely to keep up with diabetic foot care, thus increasing the risk of developing ulcers. However, with the use of artificial intelligence (AI), at-home patient care has become easier, which increases adherence. To better understand how new technologies, including machine learning algorithms and wearable sensors, might improve patient adherence and outcomes, we conducted a literature review of several sensor technologies, including SmartMat© and Siren Care© socks for temperature, SurroSense Rx/Orpyx© for pressure, and Orthotimer© for adherence. An initial search identified 143 peer-reviewed manuscripts, from which we selected a total of 10 manuscripts for further analysis. We examined the potential benefits of personalized content and clinician support for those receiving mobile health interventions. These findings may help to demonstrate the current and future utility of advanced technologies in improving patient adherence and outcomes, particularly in the context of diabetes management and the link between behavior and complications in diabetes, such as diabetic foot ulcers. © 2023 by the authors.","adherence; artificial intelligence; depression; diabetes; diabetic foot ulcers; technology","Diseases; Engineering education; Health risks; Machine learning; mHealth; Patient treatment; Sirens; Wearable sensors; Adherence; Depression; Diabetic foot; Diabetic foot ulcer; High tech; Home patients; Mental health; Patient's suffering; Physical health; Technology; Learning algorithms; artificial intelligence; diabetes mellitus; diabetic foot; human; machine learning; therapy; Artificial Intelligence; Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetic Foot; Humans; Machine Learning","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (2052578); National Science Foundation, NSF; National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, NIDDK, (1R01124789-01A1); National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, NIDDK","This study is partially supported by National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases Award Number 1R01124789-01A1.

However, due to the diversities of wearable devices, physiological signals, educational emotions, and educational contexts, there is lack of consensus on the affordance and constraints of wearable devices for measuring emotions in education. The present study conducted a systematic literature review and examined 50 peer-reviewed journal articles and influential proceedings published over the last 15 years (January 2008 to December 2022). Five research questions were addressed concerning research backgrounds, theoretical frameworks, methodologies, remaining challenges, and ethical considerations. Findings demonstrated that while most studies focused on university students in controlled environments, recent advances in wearable devices have enabled emotion measurements of younger learners in natural settings. Research interests have developed towards understanding the theoretical connections between emotion and cognition leveraging wearable devices. Electrodermal activity and heart rate were the most frequently measured signals whereas “engagement”, “positive”, and “anxiety” were the most studied emotions. Machine learning and inferential statistics were often adopted to examine associations between physiological signals and educational emotions. Moreover, we identified a need for updated ethical guidelines in advanced data collection using wearable devices. This review can not only inform wearable device usages in educational practices but also shed light on future research. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Data science applications in education; Distributed learning environments; Evaluation methodologies; Teaching/learning strategies","Ethical technology; Physiology; Wearable technology; Application in education; Data science application in education; Distributed learning environments; Evaluation methodologies; Physiological signals; Real- time; Science applications; Systematic Review; Teaching/learning strategy; Wearable devices; Computer aided instruction","","","","","(HKU 17607018, T44-707/16-N); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61703357); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","Funding text 1: Funding: This work was supported by the Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong S.

Gaining unauthorized access to these connected devices can cause security, privacy attacks (SP) that adversely impacts the user immersive experience (UIX). In this article, we identify potential SP attack surfaces that impact the application usability and immersion experience, and propose a novel anomaly detection method to detect attacks before the UIX can be disrupted. Specifically, we apply: (i) machine learning techniques such as a multi-label KNN classification algorithm to detect anomaly events of network-based attacks that include potential threat scenarios of DoS (packet tampering, packet drop, packet duplication), and (ii) statistical analysis techniques that use a combination of boolean and threshold functions (Z-scores) to detect an anomaly related to application-based attacks (Unauthorized access). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed anomaly detection method using a VRLE application case study viz., vSocial, specifically designed for teaching youth with learning impediments about social cues and interactions. Based on our detection results, we validate the impact of network and application based SP attacks on the VRLE UIX. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","anomaly detection; machine learning; security and privacy; user immersive experience; Virtual reality","Anomaly detection; Boolean functions; Computer aided instruction; E-learning; Virtual reality; Anomaly detection methods; Immersive; Machine-learning; Privacy Attacks; Security and privacy; Security/privacy; Unauthorized access; User immersive experience; Virtual reality learning environments; Machine learning","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (CNS-1647213, CNS-1659134, CNS-2114035); National Science Foundation, NSF","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation under Awards CNS-2114035, CNS-1647213 and CNS-1659134.","Impact of Iot on Augmented and Virtual Reality, (2017); M.-C., An intelligent virtual-reality system with multi-model sensing for cue-elicited craving in patients with methamphetamine use disorder, IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering, 68, 7, pp. 2270-2280, (2021); J.-W., The virtual environment of things (VEoT): A framework for integrating smart things into networked virtual environments, pp. 456-459, (2014); C., Towards a social virtual reality learning environment in high fidelity, 2018-January, pp. 1-4, (2018); B., Immersive virtual reality for foreign language education: A PRISMA systematic review, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 48952-48962, (2021); Internet of Things Survey on Security and Privacy, (2017); L., The Internet of Things: A survey, Computer Networks, 54, 15, pp. 2787-2805, (2010); P., Immersive Virtual Reality Attacks and the Human Joystick, IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing, 18, 2, pp. 550-562, (2021); M., Artificial Neural Networks-Based Machine Learning for Wireless Networks: A Tutorial, IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials, 21, 4, pp. 3039-3071, (2019); S.S., vSocial: a cloud-based system for social virtual reality learning environment applications in special education, Multimedia Tools and Applications, 80, 11, pp. 16827-16856, (2021)","K.A.

We explore the application of artificial intelligence to education, using AI devices for classroom behavior analysis. Embedded systems are special-purpose computer systems tailored to an application. Embedded system hardware for wearable devices is often characterized by low computing power and small storage, and it cannot run complex models. We apply lightweight models to embedded devices to achieve real-time emotion recognition. When teachers teach in the classroom, embedded portable devices can collect images in real-time and identify and count students’ emotions. Teachers can adjust teaching methods and obtain better teaching results through feedback on students’ learning status. Our optimized lightweight model PIDM runs on low-computing embedded devices with fast response times and reliable accuracy, which can be effectively used in the classroom. Compared with traditional post-class analysis, our method is real-time and gives teachers timely feedback during teaching. The experiments in the control group showed that after using smart devices, the classroom teaching effect increased by 9.44%. Intelligent embedded devices can help teachers keep abreast of students’ learning status and promote the improvement of classroom teaching quality. © 2023 by the authors.","behavior analysis; education science; embedded devices; emotion recognition","artificial intelligence; education; equipment; hardware; learning; real time; teaching","","","","","(202102476009); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61831015); Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE, (2018C01014)","Mixed Reality Holographic Teaching Application Project of Science and Technology Development Center, Ministry of Education (2018C01014); Development of Teaching Resources for Artificial Intelligence Major Course, Department of Higher Education, Ministry of Education Industry-University Cooperation Collaborative Education Project (202102476009); National Natural Science Foundation of China (61831015).","H., EmotionCues: Emotion-Oriented Visual Summarization of Classroom Videos, IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, 27, 7, pp. 3168-3181, (2021); W.B., Real-Time Emotion Recognition System to Monitor Student's Mood in a Classroom, Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 1413, 1, (2019); China Educ Technol Equip, (2011); Clearing House, (2011); Applied Behavior Analysis for Teachers, (2003); C.P., Near-eye display with a triple-channel waveguide for metaverse, Optics Express, 30, 17, pp. 31256-31266, (2022); M.J., Letting Artificial Intelligence in Education out of the Box: Educational Cobots and Smart Classrooms, International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, 26, 2, pp. 701-712, (2016); T.A., Educational virtual environments: A ten-year review of empirical research (1999-2009), Computers and Education, 56, 3, pp. 769-780, (2011); V., Recent advances in conversational intelligent tutoring systems, AI Magazine, 34, 3, pp. 42-54, (2013); Asian Journal of Distance Education, (2019)","W.

Technology-based assisted living solutions can effectively be used to enable older adults to optimise their health-related quality of life, as well as to promote an active and healthy longevity. This paper describes vINCI—an interdisciplinary research project to actively support assisted living for older adults via state-of-the-art assistive technologies—which seamlessly deploys an ambient intelligence environment to integrate wearable devices, networking, software, and personalised services. It entails clinical validation and feedback at home and residential care facilities via a cloud microservices platform. Underpinned by blockchain technologies, multiple wearable devices, apps, and cameras securely capture the anonymised facets of different life events, whilst machine learning models create individualised user profiles to analyse any decrease in the perceived health-related quality of life typically associated with old age. Two controlled pilots are being conducted with 80 participants at older adult facilities in Romania and Cyprus. By incorporating clinical validation and feedback from specialised practitioners, the vINCI technologies enable older adults not only to self-evaluate their physical activity level, but also to change their behaviours and lifestyle in the long-term. © 2021, The Author(s).","Ambient intelligence; Assisted living; Assistive technologies; Blockchain; Clinical validation; Cloud computing; IoT; Machine Learning; Older Adults; Quality of Life","Ambient intelligence; Assisted living; Assistive technology; Engineering education; Feedback; Internet of things; Machine learning; Sustainable development; Wearable technology; Block-chain; Clinical validations; Cloud-computing; Health-related quality of lives; IoT; Machine-learning; Old age; Older adults; Quality of life; Blockchain","","","","","(AAL2017-63-vINCI)","Funding text 1: Authors acknowledge the contribution of the project’s industrial partners: Connected Medical Devices (Romania), Automa Srl and Optima Molliter Srl (Italy) in the development and provisioning of the smartwatches and smart insoles’ related technologies, respectively.; Funding text 2: This article is based upon work from vINCI: “Clinically-validated INtegrated Support for Assistive Care and Lifestyle Improvement: the Human Link” https://vinci.ici.ro/ , a project funded by the Europen Union’s Active Assisted Living Programme under grant agreement AAL2017-63-vINCI.","H., Wireless sensor networks for healthcare: A survey, Computer Networks, 54, 15, pp. 2688-2710, (2010); H., Multi-resident activity tracking and recognition in smart environments, Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing, 8, 4, pp. 513-529, (2017); O., Neurocognitive disorders in DSM 5 project - Personal comments, Journal of the Neurological Sciences, 322, 1-2, pp. 17-19, (2012); Patient Profile Using Ontologies in an Older Adults Monitoring Iot Based Platform, (2019); L., A Holistic Approach for Creating a Digital Ecosystem Enabling Personalized Assistive Care for Elderly, pp. 89-95, (2018); M.M., Quality of life in assisted living facilities: Viewpoints of residents, Journal of Applied Gerontology, 19, 3, pp. 304-325, (2000); P.D., Assessment of mood in aphasia following stroke: validation of the Dynamic Visual Analogue Mood Scales (D-VAMS), Clinical Rehabilitation, 32, 1, pp. 94-102, (2018); S.V., Physical Activity and Mental Well-being in a Cohort Aged 60-64 Years, American Journal of Preventive Medicine, 49, 2, pp. 172-180, (2015); K.T., Physical activity in the prevention and amelioration of osteoporosis in women: Interaction of mechanical, hormonal and dietary factors, Sports Medicine, 35, 9, pp. 779-830, (2005); I., Fall detection system with portable camera, Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing, 11, 7, pp. 2647-2659, (2020)","S.

These applications often require digitization of the handwritten characters and associated hand movements to facilitate effective analysis and interpretation of the underlying task. Offline and online handwriting recognition are crucial steps involving the digitization of handwritten characters. Most of these existing systems actively use image processing techniques that are highly sensitive to environmental lighting conditions. Surface Electromyography signals (sEMG), being invariant to lighting conditions, are used in online handwriting recognition to facilitate the automatic transcription of handwritten characters. In this article, we have leveraged deep representation learning to build an efficient and robust sEMG-based Handwritten Character Recognition (HCR) pipeline. A Stacked sparse denoising autoencoder network is applied to obtain an effective deep feature representation. These rich low dimensional features obtained are further introduced into basic classifiers, producing state-of-the-art accuracy for the task. Additional experiments were performed to analyze the effect of the fusion of complementary sensing modules (Accelerometer and Gyroscope) on the performance of sEMG based HCR pipeline. Extensive evaluations were performed to ensure the validity of the obtained results. For the experimentation, new datasets consisting of sEMG, Accelerometer, and Gyroscope signals corresponding to 26 handwritten lower English alphabets were collected from 15 subjects. Our proposed pipeline can be used to build real-time Human–Computer Interaction(HCI) applications for smart classrooms facilitating digitization of handwritten notes and clinical applications involving handwriting analysis tasks. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Accelerometers; Biomedical signal processing; Deep learning; Electromyogram; Gyroscopes","Biomedical signal processing; Character recognition; Deep learning; Gyroscopes; Human computer interaction; Image processing; Learning systems; Lighting; Pipelines; Wearable sensors; Biomedical signals processing; Deep feature learning; Digitisation; Electromyo grams; Hand-written characters; Handwritten character recognition; Lighting conditions; Online handwriting recognition; Surface electromyography signals; Accelerometers; adaptive behavior; adult; Article; back propagation; comparative study; controlled study; deep learning; denoising autoencoder; digitization; electromyogram; feature extraction; female; hand movement; handwriting; handwritten character recognition; human; human computer interaction; image processing; image segmentation; leveraging deep feature learning; male; mean squared error; muscle contraction; needle electromyography; normal human; performance indicator; sparse autoencoder; stacked autoencoder; surface electromyography","","","","","","We thank Dr. Shiru Sharma, Associate Professor, School of Biomedical Engineering IIT BHU, for providing the MyoArmband for data collection.

One of the more frequent means of surgical skills evaluation is through a qualitative assessment of a surgeon’s portfolio alongside other supporting pieces of information, a process which is rather subjective. The contribution presented as part of this paper involves the use of a set of Delsys Trigno EMG wearable sensors, which track and record the muscular activation patterns of a surgeon during a surgical procedure, alongside computationally driven artificial intelligence (AI) methods towards the differentiation and ranking of the surgical skills of a clinician in a quantitative fashion. The participants in the research involved novice-level surgeons, intermediate-level surgeons and expert-level surgeons in various simulated surgical cases. A comparison of different signal processing approaches has shown that the proposed approach can prove beneficial in monitoring and differentiating the skillsets of various surgeons for various kinds of surgical cases. The presented method could also be used to track the evolution of the surgical competencies of various trainee surgeons at various stages during their training. © 2023 by the authors.","artificial intelligence; EMG; machine learning; signal processing; surgery; surgical education; wearable sensors","","","","","","","","J.D., Surgical skill and complication rates after bariatric surgery, New England Journal of Medicine, 369, 15, pp. 1434-1442, (2013); A.L., Graduating general surgery resident operative confidence: Perspective from a national survey, Journal of Surgical Research, 190, 2, pp. 419-428, (2014); R., Evaluation of surgical skill using machine learning with optimal wearable sensor locations, PLOS ONE, 17, 6 June, (2022); H., Evaluating Surgical Skills from Kinematic Data Using Convolutional Neural Networks, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 11073 LNCS, pp. 214-221, (2018); E., Deep neural networks for the assessment of surgical skills: A systematic review, Journal of Defense Modeling and Simulation, 19, 2, pp. 159-171, (2022); V., Artificial Intelligence Distinguishes Surgical Training Levels in a Virtual Reality Spinal Task, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, 101, 23, (2019); D., Evaluation of surgical skills during robotic surgery by deep learning-based multiple surgical instrument tracking in training and actual operations, Journal of Clinical Medicine, 9, 6, pp. 1-15, (2020); J.L., Automation of surgical skill assessment using a three-stage machine learning algorithm, Scientific Reports, 11, 1, (2021); J., Automated Vision-Based Microsurgical Skill Analysis in Neurosurgery Using Deep Learning: Development and Preclinical Validation, World Neurosurgery, 149, pp. e669-e686, (2021); E., Gesture recognition for transhumeral prosthesis control using EMG and NIR, IET Cyber-systems and Robotics, 2, 3, pp. 122-131, (2020)","E.

In recent years, sign language detection has emerged as a promising field of research. Sign language detection uses cameras, sensors, and machine learning algorithms to interpret and translate sign language. One of the primary directions for future research involves the expansion of recognized vocabulary and gestures.. This entails accommodating new signs, specialized signs, and regional variants, making sign language detection systems more adaptable to diverse signing patterns. Another pivotal avenue is the integration of multimodal recognition, combining visual data from cameras and depth sensors with other sensor inputs like wearable devices. This fusion of data sources will enable more context-rich and accurate recognition, especially in complex signing environments where multiple cues can enhance the understanding of signs. In education, sign language detection can play a pivotal role in enhancing accessibility.. Future applications may encompass sign language interpretation for online courses, sign language learning apps, and interactive educational tools, fostering inclusivity in learning environments. Lastly, the expansion of sign language detection to encompass multiple sign languages from around the world will make these technologies more globally inclusive and accessible.. The future scope of sign language detection projects holds the promise of bridging communication gaps, fostering inclusivity, and empowering sign language users across a wide spectrum of applications and domains. © 2023 IEEE.","Detection; DHH; ML; Sign Language; TensorFlow","Audition; Cameras; Computer aided instruction; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine learning; Sensor data fusion; Wearable sensors; Camera sensor; Deaf and hard of hearing; Detection; Hard of hearings; Language detection; Machine learning algorithms; ML; Multi-modal; Sign language; Tensorflow; Expansion","","","","","","","J.S., Teenagers and Young Adults Who Are Deaf or Hard of Hearing: A Snapshot of Acculturation in High School and Post-Secondary Life, Ear and Hearing, 44, 1, pp. 179-188, (2023); Y., Preprocessing for Keypoint-Based Sign Language Translation without Glosses, Sensors, 23, 6, (2023); Multilingual Facilitation, (2021); M.C., Application of machine learning approaches to analyse student success for contact learning and emergency remote teaching and learning during the COVID-19 era in speech–language pathology and audiology, South African Journal of Communication Disorders, 69, 2, (2022); Res Comput Sci, (2019); C., Enhanced Multi-Channel Feature Synthesis for Hand Gesture Recognition Based on CNN with a Channel and Spatial Attention Mechanism, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 144610-144620, (2020); Y., Study of plant animation synthesis by unity3D, IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology, 452, pp. 344-350, (2015); Y., Prediction of hepatitis E using machine learning models, PLOS ONE, 15, 9 September, (2020); F.H., Robust Classification and Detection of Big Medical Data Using Advanced Parallel K-Means Clustering, YOLOv4, and Logistic Regression, Life, 13, 3, (2023); Z., SignBERT: A BERT-Based Deep Learning Framework for Continuous Sign Language Recognition, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 161669-161682, (2021)","R.

Just for New Zealand alone, 2.1 billion dollars are spent annually on diabetes management. This is 4 times the current tertiary education budget in the same country. Compared to the traditional cumulative HbA1c marker of glucose used to monitor the health of diabetics, continuous glucose monitoring allows for tracking the trends in glucose value in real time. It also helps in gauging important statistics such as time in range of glucose values. For healthy individuals, glucose tracking can inform the user of the effect various activities and foods have on an individual's level. This paper aims to present a method of predicting the level of glucose through wearable continuous glucose monitors (Empatica E4 and Dexcom) and machine learning. The data from these wearable sensors comprises of inter beat interval (IBI), electrodermal activity (EDA), tri-axial accelerometry (ACC), heart rate (HR), skin temperature, food log, and blood volume pulse (BVP). It was collected over 8-10 days for 19 individuals and used to calculate 73 statistical features. 69 features were used from previous literature and 4 novel features proposed in this research were used. These features were in turn used to train support vector machine (SVM) and decision tree model (DTM) with stratified K-fold validation which yield accuracies of 69.10 ± 14.2 % and 72.38 ± 2.4 %. The combined feature importance of the 4 novel features was calculated to be 5%, highlighting their significance in the model. © 2023 IEEE.","Feature Engineering; Interstitial Glucose; Machine Learning; Wearable Sensors","Blood; Budget control; Decision trees; Learning systems; Support vector machines; Wearable sensors; 'current; Blood glucose level; Diabetes management; Feature engineerings; Glucose level; Increasing costs; Interstitial glucose; Interstitials; Machine-learning; New zealand; Glucose","","","","","","","E.C., Development of a Virtual diabetes register using information technology in New Zealand, Healthcare Informatics Research, 21, 1, pp. 49-55, (2015); S.J., The Cost-Effectiveness of Real-Time Continuous Glucose Monitoring (RT-CGM) in Type 2 Diabetes, Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology, 10, 4, pp. 898-904, (2016); K.L., Development of metabolic systems, Physiology and Behavior, 86, 5, pp. 646-660, (2005); C., Human Systems Biology and Metabolic Modelling: A Review-From Disease Metabolism to Precision Medicine, BioMed Research International, 2019, (2019); R.R., HbA1c: How do we measure it and what does it mean?, Current Opinion in Endocrinology, Diabetes and Obesity, 16, 2, pp. 113-118, (2009); H., Recent advances in transdermal sensors for glucose monitoring, Current Opinion in Biomedical Engineering, 20, (2021); M., Hba1c as a biomarker of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: Comparison with anthropometric parameters, Journal of Clinical and Translational Hepatology, 9, 1, pp. 15-21, (2021); S.I., Significance of HbA1c test in diagnosis and prognosis of diabetic patients, Biomarker Insights, 11, pp. 95-104, (2016); M.A.L., Time in range: A new parameter to evaluate blood glucose control in patients with diabetes, Diabetology and Metabolic Syndrome, 12, 1, (2020); B., Non-invasive wearables for remote monitoring of HbA1c and glucose variability: Proof of concept, BMJ Open Diabetes Research and Care, 9, 1, (2021)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE Computer Society","2023 IEEE Asia-Pacific Conference on Computer Science and Data Engineering, CSDE 2023","2023-12-04 through 2023-12-06","Nadi","198636","","9798350341072","","","English","Proc.

With the increasing integration of technology in education, the ability to monitor and understand student behavior during exams has become crucial for educators and institutions. DML offers a powerful approach to process and analyze data collected from various sources, such as online exams, wearable devices, and eye-tracking sensors. This study proposes a framework that employs DML techniques to gather, process, and interpret student behavioral data in real-time. The collected data encompasses factors like gaze patterns, typing speed, hesitation intervals, and physiological responses. By employing machine learning algorithms distributed across multiple nodes, the system aims to provide insights into student engagement, cognitive load, and potential instances of academic misconduct. The analysis of behavioral patterns during examinations can aid educators in adapting teaching methodologies, providing timely interventions, and enhancing the overall learning experience.

MMLA focuses on research within intermediary spaces - between research and classroom application, bridging private and public learning contexts by tracking students' interactions with social media and connected devices, and exploring context-aware and adaptive technologies. However, there is a dearth of evidence demonstrating the successful application of multimodal learning findings in classroom settings on a larger scale. The encroachment on students' privacy due to the intrusive nature of multimodal data collection methods, often involving sensors and recording technologies, remains a substantial concern that necessitates attention. This study systematically reviews multimodal learning analytics, examining aspects such as data collection rationale, data scope, study contexts, ethical considerations, commercial interests, and downstream data uses.

We propose a new approach that systematically integrates signal processing and systems analysis with key techniques in machine learning. In the proposed course, the student obtains hands-on experience in applying algorithms that can be applied to practical problems of physiological signal conditioning, analysis and interpretation. This is achieved by exposing the student to a sequence of 4 applications-based modules that represent different biomedical engineering problems: human activity recognition from wearable devices, epileptic seizure detection, quantification of dynamic respiratory-cardiac coupling in humans under different conditions, and detection of sleep apnea episodes from heart rate variability data. Within each module, the student gains the experience of working with the data in question ""from the ground up"". We also introduce a general plan for assessment of student learning, and discuss the expected outcomes and limitations of this integrative approach to teaching.Clinical Relevance - The proposed course is targeted at biomedical engineering students at the senior undergraduate or first-year graduate level who are interested in learning how to analyze physiological signals. The course would also be suitable for clinician-scientists who have prior training in statistics with some exposure to engineering mathematics. © 2023 IEEE.","","Biomedical engineering; Biomedical signal processing; Engineering education; Machine learning; Systems analysis; Biomedical engineering curriculum; Biomedical signals processing; Data analytics; Engineering course; Integrating machines; Machine-learning; New approaches; Physiological signals; Signals and systems; Traditional engineerings; Students; algorithm; biomedical engineering; curriculum; human; mathematics; student; Algorithms; Biomedical Engineering; Curriculum; Humans; Mathematics","","","","","","","W.S., A logical calculus of the ideas immanent in nervous activity, The Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics, 5, 4, pp. 115-133, (1943); A.Y., Cardiologist-level arrhythmia detection and classification in ambulatory electrocardiograms using a deep neural network, Nature Medicine, 25, 1, pp. 65-69, (2019); T., Automated detection of COVID-19 cases using deep neural networks with X-ray images, Computers in Biology and Medicine, 121, (2020); J.L., Computerised clinical decision support systems and absolute improvements in care: Meta-analysis of controlled clinical trials, BMJ, 370, (2020); C., Integration of novel monitoring devices with machine learning technology for scalable cardiovascular management, Nature Reviews Cardiology, 18, 2, pp. 75-91, (2021); Biomede 499 060, (2016); Department of Biomedical Engineering Courses Carnegie Mellon University, (2022); European Symposium on Artificial Neural Networks Computational Intelligence and Machine Learning, (2023); S., Human Activity Recognition Using K-Nearest Neighbor Machine Learning Algorithm, Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies, 262 SIST, pp. 304-313, (2022); L., Human activity recognition model based on decision tree, pp. 64-68, (2013)","P.

Emerging work in this area has mainly focused on modelling group-level interactions from low-level x-y positioning data. Yet, little work has utilised such data to automatically identify individual-level differences among students working in co-located groups in terms of procedural and social aspects such as task prioritisation and collaboration dynamics, respectively. To address this gap, this study characterised key differences among 124 students’ procedural and social behaviours according to their perceived stress, collaboration, and task satisfaction during a complex group task using wearable positioning sensors and ordered networked analysis. The results revealed that students who demonstrated more collaborative behaviours were associated with lower stress and higher collaboration satisfaction. Interestingly, students who worked individually on the primary and secondary learning tasks reported lower and higher task satisfaction, respectively. These findings can deepen our understanding of students’ individual-level behaviours and experiences while learning in groups. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Collaborative Learning; Educational Data Mining; Learning Analytics; Ordered Network Analysis; Satisfaction; Stress","Data mining; Learning systems; Social aspects; Wearable sensors; Collaborative learning; Educational data mining; Individual levels; Learning analytic; Learning behavior; Learning tasks; Model groups; Ordered network analyse; Satisfaction; Social behaviour; Students","","","","","Australian Government; Australian Research Council, ARC, (DP210100060); Australian Research Council, ARC; Jacobs Foundation","Acknowledgements.

Metaverse design needs to be handled together with the internet, social networks, computer games, virtual reality glasses, augmented reality software, the internet of things, wearable devices, 5G/6G internet infrastructure, cryptocurrencies, artificial intelligence, and robotics technologies. The Metaverse in design is a concept that covers every field, from education to art, from commerce to health, and from games to entertainment. Platforms, where many people of different languages, religions, races, and ages can interact simultaneously with avatars, AR/VR, smart devices, and wearables, have the potential to generate enormous amounts of data. The analysis of this produced data with advanced artificial intelligence techniques has critical importance in terms of both the ecosystem’s continuity and the user experience’s improvement. Artificial intelligence and robotic technologies act as a bridge between the real and virtual worlds in Metaverse platforms. To provide communication between human–avatar, avatar–avatar, human–robot, and robot–avatar, natural language recognition, voice recognition, voice-to-text conversion, and text-to-speech conversion tasks can be performed with artificial intelligence technologies. Metaverse platforms, where individuals in the real world can control their avatars or robots in the virtual world with various hardware, communicate with others, and produce rich digital content, also promise to make their economies. However, such a Metaverse ecosystem has not been created, as the necessary technology and infrastructure are not yet available. In addition, the hardware required for users to enter these Metaverse platforms is limited in number, quite expensive, cumbersome, and unsuitable for long-term use. For this reason, technology companies and social media giants are investing heavily to create their Metaverse ecosystems. Therefore, the future of the internet is shaped in parallel with the development of infrastructure and technology. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2023.","Artificial Intelligence; Future; Metaverse; Robotics; Technology","Augmented reality; Character recognition; Computer games; Computer hardware; Ecosystems; Emotion Recognition; Human computer interaction; Human robot interaction; Intelligent robots; Interactive computer graphics; Social sciences computing; Speech recognition; Wearable technology; Artificial intelligence technologies; Future; Metaverses; Multiusers; Real- time; Real-world; Robotic solutions; Robotic technologies; Technology; Virtual worlds; Virtual reality","","","","","","","Reskin A Versatile Replaceable Low Cost Skin for AI Research on Tactile Perception; undefined; M., Frustratingly short attention spans in neural language modeling, (2017); Residual Memory Networks in Language Modeling Improving the Reputation of Feed Forward Networks, (2017); B., Malware classification with LSTM and GRU language models and a character-level CNN, Proceedings - ICASSP, IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, pp. 2482-2486, (2017); L.-C., DeepLab: Semantic Image Segmentation with Deep Convolutional Nets, Atrous Convolution, and Fully Connected CRFs, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 40, 4, pp. 834-848, (2018); T., Recent trends in deep learning based natural language processing [Review Article], IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine, 13, 3, pp. 55-75, (2018); P., Virtual Reality Video Quality Assessment Based on 3d Convolutional Neural Networks, Proceedings - International Conference on Image Processing, ICIP, 2019-September, pp. 3187-3191, (2019); D., BFGAN: Backward and Forward Generative Adversarial Networks for Lexically Constrained Sentence Generation, IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio Speech and Language Processing, 27, 12, pp. 2350-2361, (2019); Dota 2 with Large Scale Deep Reinforcement Learning, (2019)","N.

When using immersive content utilizing these technologies, various interface methods are employed. Direct contact or wearable devices that can recognize user actions for interaction have physical limitations caused by the difficulty of accurately recognizing user movements and the use of surrounding equipment. Similarly, camera-based interfaces that recognize user actions have physical limitations due to wired connections to the main body and compatibility issues with other operating systems due to noncompliance to any global or national standards.In this paper, we propose a metaverse avatar teleport system based on user pose estimation using AIoT edge devices on the oneM2M IoT platform. The proposed system transmits the final human pose skeleton estimated by PoseNet to the Teleport Information Extractor after receiving the input image from the webcam. The teleport information extractor extracts four keypoints that serve as the basis for posture estimation for teleportation from the transmitted human pose skeleton and estimates one of the three postures for teleportation using those keypoints. The estimated teleport information is then sent from the IoT client M/W to the IoT server M/W.The metaverse interworking module, which is designed for integration with the metaverse, receives the Teleport Information through communication using HTTP and MQTT. And IoT server M/W transmits the teleport command corresponding to the received Teleport Information to the metaverse server, thereby repositioning the user avatar's position and direction vector in the metaverse. This system is compatible with all devices that comply with the oneM2M standard and does not have spatial constraints when using content due to the use of network-based connections instead of wired connections. © 2023 IEEE.","artificial intelligence of things; digital twin; metaverse; pose estimation; virtual reality","HTTP; Internet of things; Musculoskeletal system; Wearable technology; Artificial intelligence of thing; Direct contact; Human pose; Immersive; Keypoints; Metaverses; Physical limitations; Pose-estimation; User action; Wired connection; Virtual reality","","","","","Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (IITP-2023-2021-0-01816)","Funding text 1: ACKNOWLEDGMENT This research was supported by the MSIT(Ministry of Science and ICT), Korea, under the ITRC(Information Technology Research Center) support program(IITP-2023-2021-0-01816) supervised by the IITP(Institute for Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation; Funding text 2: This research was supported by the MSIT(Ministry of Science and ICT), Korea, under the ITRC(Information Technology Research Center) support program(IITP-2023-2021-0-01816) supervised by the IITP(Institute for Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation)","Review of Korea Contents Association, (2021); J., Digital twin-driven manufacturing cyber-physical system for parallel controlling of smart workshop, Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing, 10, 3, pp. 1155-1166, (2019); Z., BlockNet: Beyond reliable spatial Digital Twins to Parallel Metaverse, Patterns, 3, 5, (2022); D., The metaverse in the hospitality and tourism industry: An overview of current trends and future research directions, Journal of Hospitality Marketing and Management, 31, 5, pp. 527-534, (2022); A., Virtual Reality for Shoulder Rehabilitation: Accuracy Evaluation of Oculus Quest 2, Sensors, 22, 15, (2022); Proc Hick 2020, (2020); Eccv, (2018); Journal of the Institute of Internet Broadcasting and Communication Jiibc, (2017); Iemek J Embed Sys Appl, (2022); H., Analysis of identifiers in IoT platforms, Digital Communications and Networks, 6, 3, pp. 333-340, (2020)","J.-W.

We explore the potential of motion sensors in a smartwatch to understand the writing micro-events - hand shift, line change, and actual writing. The ability to detect these writing micro-events opens up different possible studies, such as studying the students' cognitive load, comparing students of a different or similar caliber, their familiarity with given content, and cheating during examinations. Unlike existing work on handwriting using commercial smartwatches, which focuses on writing content or writer detection, we focus on detecting the writing micro-events. In our offline evaluation with data from ten participants, we observe F1 scores up to 0.84 for writing conditions of copying, writing from memory, and writing original text.

MMLA capitalizes on data gleaned from diverse interactions, utilizing wearable devices to track physiological responses. This yields deeper insights into factors such as cognitive load, stress levels, interest, and other stimuli pivotal to the learning process. Nonetheless, it is crucial to acknowledge the theoretical and practical challenges underpinning the integration of wearable devices into learning experiences, both in academic settings and in everyday life activities. A systematic review of the literature (SLR) was conducted to identify the characteristics of studies that incorporate wearable devices into teaching-learning process analyses. The outcomes enabled us to discern key attributes such as participant descriptions, the activities implemented for data collection, and a broad spectrum of biometric indicators, with electrodermal activity (EDA) and heart rate (HR) among the most commonly employed methodologies in data analysis. Future endeavors should be centered on the formation of interdisciplinary teams. The objective is to devise novel methodologies for multimodal data collection and analysis that can discern performance variables, thereby enhancing learning in a manner conducive to more fluid, reflective educational experiences for all participants in the teaching-learning process. © © 2023 Glasserman-Morales, Carlos-Arroyo, Ruiz-Ramirez and Alcantar-Nieblas.","biometric indicators; educational innovation; multi-modal learning analytics; teaching-learning processes; wearable devices","","","","","","Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey, ITESM","The authors acknowledge the financial and technical support of Writing Lab, the Institute for the Future of Education, Tecnologico de Monterrey, Mexico, in producing this study.

The generation of human behavior comes from the response of sensory stimuli from external factors. The current emotion detection process mainly uses artificial intelligence technology to capture the facial features of the target and compares the data through machine learning to judge the emotional state of the target. In the process of face capture, the target emotion is detected and analyzed mainly through the changes in the eyes, mouth, face, nose, and other organs, and the target emotion is determined from it, and finally, the behavior analysis and prediction are carried out in the following ways. Test results. However, the current detection technology is mainly aimed at the data collection and detection of the target face or surface, and cannot detect the psychological and body language emotional changes of the target. This paper starts with the current detection technology, uses traditional detection methods for emotion detection and behavior analysis, and compares the data with the composite emotion detection method combined with wearable technology. Through the implementation of new algorithms and the use of wearable devices, the superiority of wearable technology is reflected, which can improve the accuracy of human emotion detection and more effectively analyze and predict human behavior characteristics. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Artificial intelligence; Emotion detection; Human behavior; Machine learning; Wearable technology","Behavioral research; Electric current measurement; Emotion Recognition; Engineering education; Machine learning; Artificial intelligence technologies; Behavior analysis; Current detection; Detection methods; Detection technology; Emotion detection; Human behavior detection; Human behaviors; Human emotion; Machine-learning; Wearable technology","","","","","","","Int J Comput Vis Image Process Ijcvip, (2021); R.H., The Link Between Adaptive Memory and Cultural Attraction: New Insights for Evolutionary Ethnobiology, Evolutionary Biology, 47, 4, pp. 273-284, (2020); S., The Role of Faith-based Organizations (FBOs) in the Rehabilitation of Offenders, Oriental Anthropologist, 20, 2, pp. 262-275, (2020); J.D., Editorial overview: Cyberpsychology: reviews of research on the intersection between computer technology use and human behavior, Current Opinion in Psychology, 36, pp. iv-vii, (2020); A., Winners are not keepers: Characterizing household engagement, gains, and energy patterns in demand response using machine learning in the United States, Energy Research and Social Science, 70, (2020); undefined; K., Negative emotions detection on online mental-health related patients texts using the deep learning with MHA-BCNN model, Expert Systems with Applications, 182, (2021); S., Complex Emotion Profiling: An Incremental Active Learning Based Approach with Sparse Annotations, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 147711-147727, (2020); X., Human Motion Gesture Recognition Algorithm in Video Based on Convolutional Neural Features of Training Images, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 160025-160039, (2020); M., Transportation Mode Recognition with Deep Forest Based on GPS Data, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 150891-150901, (2020)","S.B.

While previous studies have utilized multiple sensors, such as wearable devices, to gauge engagement levels in offline environments, the shift to remote meetings due to the COVID-19 pandemic presents new challenges. In this study, we propose a method for measuring student engagement during online meetings using only the built-in web cameras on their devices. We collect high, middle, and low engagement level recording data from 24 students. We decided to collect data using the role-acting approach instead of conventional self-reporting or post-experiment annotation. With the feature extraction based approach, we achieved a classification rate of 46.7%. With a deep learning based approach, we achieved a classification rate of 89.5% using MobileNetV2 for leave-one-participant-out cross-validation, which demonstrated higher accuracy than previous studies. From the model, we implement an application EnGauge and conduct a pilot study. The results demonstrate a new approach to data collection, an optimal engagement level recognition model, and application scenarios. © 2013 IEEE.","affective computing; camera; deep neural network; Engagement classification; facial expression; social interaction","Behavioral research; Data acquisition; Deep neural networks; Extraction; Feature extraction; Gages; Image processing; Support vector machines; User interfaces; Annotation; Behavioral science; Classification rates; Engagement levels; Facial Expressions; Features extraction; Images processing; Observer; Privacy; Support vectors machine; Cameras","","","","","","","Flourish A Visionary New Understanding of Happiness and Well Being, (2011); K.A., Student participation in the college classroom: An extended multidisciplinary literature review, Communication Education, 59, 2, pp. 185-213, (2010); S., Active learning increases student performance in science, engineering, and mathematics, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 111, 23, pp. 8410-8415, (2014); Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive Mobile Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies, (2018); N., Individual and Group-wise Classroom Seating Experience: Effects on Student Engagement in Different Courses, Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive, Mobile, Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies, 6, 3, (2022); B.H., Pandemic shift: Meeting the challenges of moving post-secondary environmental education online, Environmental Education Research, 28, 1, pp. 1-17, (2022); International Journal on Advanced Science Education and Religion, (2020); Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive Mobile Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies, (2019); S., Automated mood-aware engagement prediction, 2018-January, pp. 1-8, (2017); S., Learning based visual engagement and self-efficacy, 2018-January, pp. 581-585, (2017)","K.

This issue may be addressed by implementing practical or 'hands-on' learning experiences that allow students to construct their knowledge and apply skills in real-world scenarios. This work proposes to create learning experiences supported by blended learning spaces, including traditional classrooms for direct instruction, daily-life scenarios for experiential learning enabled by wearable devices, and cloudbased programming environments for online collaborative work. The learning experience presented was implemented in a biomedical signals and systems course. Students used health wearables to record their physiological and behavioral signals in everyday scenarios and Google Collaboratory notebooks to analyze the collected data. The survey results applied to students suggest that technology-enabled blended learning spaces positively impact students' perception of their learning experience. However, other potential benefits in learning derived from the use of technologies, such as increased student engagement and motivation and improved learning outcomes, require further investigation. This is particularly relevant given the monetary investment that scaling up this pedagogical approach would need. © 2023 IEEE.","cloud computing technology; educational innovation; engineering education; higher education; learning spaces; technology-enabled learning; wearable devices","Bioelectric phenomena; Biomedical engineering; Curricula; Economics; Motivation; Students; Wearable technology; Biomedical engineering education; Blended learning; Cloud computing technologies; Educational innovations; High educations; Learning experiences; Learning space; Programming environment; Technology-enabled learning; Wearable devices; Engineering education","","","","","Novus International, (N20-166); Novus International","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support of NOVUS (Grant number: N20-166), Institute for the Future of Education, Tecnologico de Monterrey, Mexico, in the production of this work.","International Federation of Medical and Biological Engineers, (2012); Human Resources for Medical Devices the Role of Biomedical Engineers, (2017); Human Resources for Medical Devices the Role of Biomedical Engineers, (2017); R.A., What makes a biomedical engineer?, IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine, 22, 4, pp. 32-38, (2003); World Bank Group, (1998); E.J., Implementing a Design Thinking Project in a Biomedical Instrumentation Course, IEEE Transactions on Education, 63, 4, pp. 240-245, (2020); Harris, Thomas R., Challenge-based instruction in biomedical engineering: A scalable method to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of teaching and learning in biomedical engineering, Medical Engineering and Physics, 27, 7, pp. 617-624, (2005); H., Learning spaces, learning environments and the dis'placement' of learning, British Journal of Educational Technology, 41, 3, pp. 502-511, (2010); Educause Review, (2005); D.E., Expanding the concept of learning spaces for industrial engineering education, IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference, EDUCON, April-2019, pp. 669-678, (2019)","L.

In this project, a Recurrent Neural Network model was created to predict human joint accelerations through the automatic digitalization of human body movement using video and acceleration sensors. The project aimed to prevent injuries and fractures in athletes and the elderly population because there is a lack of tools that predicts the risk of these traumas as a preventive method. Acceleration data was collected using Matlab mobile installed in cell phones attached to the arms and legs of volunteers doing physical tasks (walking, running, jumping). Experiments were video recorded, and machine learning models were trained using acceleration and video using Python libraries. After model evaluation, we observed that the selected model could predict the best on the XY axes and the worst on the Z axis, probably due to predicting a three-dimensional feature with a two-dimensional input. A biomechanical Digital Twin was created by combining the information from wearable devices, computer vision, and machine learning algorithms. This tool was able to estimate human joint accelerations (up to an extent) during movements with more refinement; it can help to evaluate movement performance within exercises or tasks and aid in injury/fracture risk prediction. © 2023 IEEE.","biomechanics; biometrics; educational innovation; higher education; machine learning","Computer vision; Digital devices; E-learning; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Patient rehabilitation; Recurrent neural networks; Risk perception; Biomechanical studies; Economic resources; Educational innovations; High educations; Human joints; Machine-learning; Markerless; Organisational; Recurrent neural network model; Technical experts; Biomechanics","","","","","","","Running Injuries, (1997); Physiology Behavior, (2016); Infosys Insights, (2016); F., Personalized computed tomography - Automated estimation of height and weight of a simulated digital twin using a 3D camera and artificial intelligence, RoFo Fortschritte auf dem Gebiet der Rontgenstrahlen und der Bildgebenden Verfahren, 193, 4, pp. 437-445, (2021); R., Digital twin coaching for physical activities: A survey, Sensors, 20, 20, pp. 1-21, (2020); I., Digital Twins for Multiple Sclerosis, Frontiers in Immunology, 12, (2021); C.K., Human motion classification using 2D stick-model matching regression coefficients, Applied Mathematics and Computation, 283, pp. 70-89, (2016); Y., Lower extremity joint torque predicted by using artificial neural network during vertical jump, Journal of Biomechanics, 42, 7, pp. 906-911, (2009); A., Artificial neural networks to predict 3D spinal posture in reaching and lifting activities; Applications in biomechanical models, Journal of Biomechanics, 49, 13, pp. 2946-2952, (2016); R.A., Three-dimensional biomedical imaging, 1, pp. 1-169, (2017)","M.O.C.

In this work we investigated whether there exists a mapping between students' biosignals and perceived concentration levels. If we succeed in this mapping, a wearable can function as a Concentration Tracker, a novel feature that is missing from current wearables. For this, a wearable wristband was used to record students' heart rate, heart rate variability, skin temperature, skin conductivity and acceleration from body changes. Additionally, students self-assessed their concentration levels using a smartphone application. We improved the accuracy by utilizing a big amount of unlabelled biodata from outside the study sessions. Our best boosted regression tree model predicted students' concentration level with only 1.7% NMAE error. The predictions for a user not in the training set were much weaker; the best model, a convolutional neural network, achieved a prediction NMAE error of 30.7%. This implies that the users generated biosignals highly individually. Thus, models are not well transferable from one user to another without rooting them in user-specific data. Contrary to stress research, our results showed that skin conductivity had mostly a negative correlation with students' concentration levels. Also diverging from stress reactions, skin temperature had mainly a positive correlation. Conductivity and temperature were the two dominant predictors. Further, the results suggest that an element of deep, effortless concentration was present in the learning experience of the subjects. Altogether, our work demonstrates that a concentration tracking wearable for improving learning is technically achievable. © 2013 IEEE.","Affective computing; affective learning; artificial intelligence; biosignals; convolutional neural networks; educational technology; machine learning; mental concentration; semi-supervised learning; wearable sensors","Convolution; Heart; Mapping; Neural networks; Supervised learning; Wearable sensors; Affective Computing; Affective learning; Biosignals; Convolutional neural network; Educational course; Educational program; Machine-learning; Mental concentration; Semi-supervised learning; Students","","","","","","","APA Dictionary of Psychology, (2022); Effect of Technology on Attention and Concentration within the Classroom Context, (2010); J.T., Modeling the relationships among reading instruction, motivation, engagement, and achievement for adolescents, Reading Research Quarterly, 48, 1, pp. 9-26, (2013); R.M., Student engagement and student learning: Testing the linkages, Research in Higher Education, 47, 1, pp. 1-32, (2006); P., The nature of procrastination: A meta-analytic and theoretical review of quintessential self-regulatory failure, Psychological Bulletin, 133, 1, pp. 65-94, (2007); D.M., Mental engagement during cognitive and psychomotor tasks: Effects of task type, processing demands, and practice, International Journal of Psychophysiology, 109, pp. 124-131, (2016); Pärkkä, Juha, Automatic feature selection and classification of physical and mental load using data from wearable sensors, (2010); R.W., Affective learning - a manifesto, BT Technology Journal, 22, 4, pp. 253-269, (2004); Psychology Science, (2007); Holling, Heinz Dieter, Self-estimates of intelligence - Methodological approaches and gender differences, Personality and Individual Differences, 38, 3, pp. 503-517, (2005)","C.

The rich granularity of sensor data offers great potential for analyzing patterns and changes in physical activity behaviors. The use of specialized machine learning and data mining techniques to detect, extract, and analyze these patterns has increased, helping to better understand how participants’ physical activity evolves. Objective: The aim of this systematic review was to identify and present the various data mining techniques employed to analyze changes in physical activity behaviors from sensors-derived data in health education and health promotion intervention studies. We addressed two main research questions: (1) What are the current techniques used for mining physical activity sensor data to detect behavior changes in health education or health promotion contexts? (2) What are the challenges and opportunities in mining physical activity sensor data for detecting physical activity behavior changes? Methods: The systematic review was performed in May 2021 using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. We queried the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), IEEE Xplore, ProQuest, Scopus, Web of Science, Education Resources Information Center (ERIC), and Springer literature databases for peer-reviewed references related to wearable machine learning to detect physical activity changes in health education. A total of 4388 references were initially retrieved from the databases. After removing duplicates and screening titles and abstracts, 285 references were subjected to full-text review, resulting in 19 articles included for analysis. Results: All studies used accelerometers, sometimes in combination with another sensor (37%). Data were collected over a period ranging from 4 days to 1 year (median 10 weeks) from a cohort size ranging between 10 and 11615 (median 74). Data preprocessing was mainly carried out using proprietary software, generally resulting in step counts and time spent in physical activity aggregated predominantly at the daily or minute level. The main features used as input for the data mining models were descriptive statistics of the preprocessed data. The most common data mining methods were classifiers, clusters, and decision-making algorithms, and these focused on personalization (58%) and analysis of physical activity behaviors (42%). Conclusions: Mining sensor data offers great opportunities to analyze physical activity behavior changes, build models to better detect and interpret behavior changes, and allow for personalized feedback and support for participants, especially where larger sample sizes and longer recording times are available. Exploring different data aggregation levels can help detect subtle and sustained behavior changes. However, the literature suggests that there is still work remaining to improve the transparency, explicitness, and standardization of the data preprocessing and mining processes to establish best practices and make the detection methods easier to understand, scrutinize, and reproduce. ©Claudio Diaz, Corinne Caillaud, Kalina Yacef.","activity tracker; artificial intelligence; behavior change; data mining; education; fitness trackers; health; health education; physical activity; sensor data; trackers; wearable devices; wearable electronic devices","","","","","","","","G., Daily physical activity assessment with accelerometers: New insights and validation studies, Obesity Reviews, 14, 6, pp. 451-462, (2013); F.C., World Health Organization 2020 guidelines on physical activity and sedentary behaviour, British Journal of Sports Medicine, 54, 24, pp. 1451-1462, (2020); A.V., Moving forward with accelerometer-assessed physical activity: Two strategies to ensure meaningful, interpretable, and comparable measures, Pediatric Exercise Science, 30, 4, pp. 450-456, (2018); U., The KDD Process for Extracting Useful Knowledge from Volumes of Data, Communications of the ACM, 39, 11, pp. 27-34, (1996); A., The PRISMA statement for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses of studies that evaluate health care interventions: explanation and elaboration, Journal of Clinical Epidemiology, 62, 10, pp. e1-e34, (2009); M., Rayyan-a web and mobile app for systematic reviews, Systematic Reviews, 5, 1, (2016); A., MHealth app using machine learning to increase physical activity in diabetes and depression: Clinical trial protocol for the DIAMANTE Study, BMJ Open, 10, 8, (2020); P.H., A cluster analysis of patterns of objectively measured physical activity in Hong Kong, Public Health Nutrition, 16, 8, pp. 1436-1444, (2013); M., Evaluating machine learning–based automated personalized daily step goals delivered through a mobile phone app: Randomized controlled trial, JMIR mHealth and uHealth, 6, 1, (2018); M., Automated Personalized Feedback for Physical Activity and Dietary Behavior Change with Mobile Phones: A Randomized Controlled Trial on Adults, JMIR mHealth and uHealth, 3, 2, (2015)","K.

Physical activity (PA) recommendations for high school children have not been studied previously in schools in the Qatar region. The objectives of the study were: (i) to assess the level of compliance of the recommended PA and to assess if there are any gender differences; and (ii) to analyze the recommended step count compliance during school and non-school days. An observational cross-sectional study was conducted. Twenty-nine children (12 boys and 17 girls) aged 13–17 years (15.24 ± 1.46) took part in this study. Participants wore Fitbit Charge 5 wrist bands for three weeks to collect various digital biomarkers including moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and step counts (tracking during out-of-school time and school time). Based on this study, high school children in the two Qatar region schools did not meet the MVPA and steps/day recommendation by the established agencies: 38% of the total study group met the recommended 60 min/day of activity (50% boys, 29% girls). Gender differences were also observed in PA levels and steps per day: for non-school days, 17% met the recommended 10,000 steps/day (25% boys, 12% girls). There was a pattern of greater PA performance and steps during the weekdays as opposed to the weekend, but these values showed no robust evidence in favor of H1 or statistical significance for step counts. However, the evidence was robust in favor of H1 (difference between weekend and weekday) due to a statistically significant difference for meeting the 60 min/day activity. While further studies are required to establish if this is a general trend in Qatari schools, this pilot study does highlight the need to design more effective programs and messaging strategies to improve PA levels in the high school population. © 2022 by the authors.","adolescents; children; exercise; Fitbit; fitness trackers; physical activity; Qatar; wearable devices","adolescence; artificial intelligence; biomarker; child; higher education; physical activity; Qatar","","","","","","","M., Long-term health benefits of physical activity - A systematic review of longitudinal studies, BMC Public Health, 13, 1, (2013); WHO Guidelines on Physical Activity and Sedentary Behaviour, (2020); D.E.R., Health benefits of physical activity: A systematic review of current systematic reviews, Current Opinion in Cardiology, 32, 5, pp. 541-556, (2017); Noncommunicable Diseases, (2021); Z., Associations Between the Child Care Environment and Children’s In-Care Physical Activity and Sedentary Time, Health Education and Behavior, 48, 1, pp. 42-53, (2021); E.M., Correlates of children's dietary intake, physical activity and sedentary behavior in home-based childcare: A systematic review, Preventive Medicine Reports, 30, (2022); How Much Physical Activity do Adults Need, (2011); Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, (2008); Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee Report 2008, (2008); Department of Health Physical Activity Health Improvement and Protection Start Active Stay Active A Report on Physical Activity for Health from the Four Home Countries Chief Medical Officers, (2011)","A.

Despite the importance of education to gain required expertise, there is dearth of in-depth understanding of the effectiveness of current pedagogies. Engagement is an essential aspect of any pedagogical experience, directly affecting knowledge retention. However, the traditional evaluation methods are unsuitable for objectively understanding engagement. Interpretation of physiological response can provide insight into the emotional state of learners. Recent advancements in wearable technologies and physiology offer objective approach to measure the engagement level. In this regard, this study aims to assess the feasibility of wearable physiological sensing technologies for understanding the engagement level of students learning emerging technologies in construction. The potential of electrodermal activity (EDA), photoplethysmography (PPG), and skin temperature (ST) was investigated in detecting the engagement level of students. Ten minutes of biosignals were acquired from 5 students in two different learning experiences (i.e., passive learning through slides and active learning through didactic videos). Different metrics (electrodermal level, the mean value of PPG, mean skin temperature, etc.) were calculated from the time domain and frequency domain to investigate the potential of the suggested biosignals.

Due to the proliferation of mobile devices and the development of communication technologies, mobile apps have become a popular way to deliver sleep disorder therapy or manage sleep. This scoping review aims to conduct a systematic investigation of mobile apps and technologies supporting sleep, including the essential functions of sleep apps, how they are used to improve sleep and the facilitators of and barriers to using apps among patients and other stakeholders. We searched articles (2010 to 2022) from Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct, PubMed, and IEEE Xplore using the keyword sleep apps. In total, 1,650 peer-reviewed articles were screened, and 51 were selected for inclusion. The most frequently provided functions by the apps are sleep monitoring, measuring sleep, providing alarms, and recording sleep using a sleep diary. Several wearable devices have been used with mobile apps to record sleep duration and sleep problems. Facilitators and barriers to using apps were identified, along with the evidence-based design guidelines. Existing studies have proved the initial validation and efficiency of delivering sleep treatment by mobile apps; however, more research is needed to improve the performance of sleep apps and devise a way to utilize them as a therapy tool. © © 2022 Al Mahmud, Wu and Mubin.","human computer interaction; mobile apps; sleep apnea; sleep disorder; sleep management","anxiety; behavior change; blood pressure; cell proliferation; clock (device); cognitive behavioral therapy; depression; education; exercise; feedback system; human; human computer interaction; hypertension; information; machine learning; physical activity; polysomnography; prevalence; review; Review; signal processing; sleep disorder; sleep disordered breathing; sleep medicine; sleep therapy; sleep time; sleep waking cycle; stakeholder engagement; validation process; Web of Science","","","","","","","Sleep Health Foundation, (2016); K.G., Feeling validated yet?

With the help of wearable technologies, an increasing number of scholars have a strong interest in studying the associations between student data and learning outcomes in different learning environments. This systematic review examines 120 articles published between 2011 and 2021, exploring current research on learning analytics based on wearable devices in detail from both descriptive and content analysis. The descriptive analysis reviewed the included literature in five dimensions: publication times of the reviewed literature, wearable devices and data types used in studies, stakeholders, objectives, and methods involved in the analysis procedure. The content analysis aims to examine the literature covered in terms of three categorical domains of educational objectives: cognitive, affective, and behavioral, to investigate the practical applications and potential issues of learning analytics based on wearable devices. After that, based on the overall research content of the reviewed literature, a framework for learning analytics based on wearable devices is present, and its application process is summarized and analyzed for the reference of related researchers. At last, we summarize the limitations of existing studies and present several recommendations to further promote research and development in this field. © The Author(s) 2022.","learning analytics; physiological signals; systematic review; wearable devices","","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61937001, 61977030, 62077017); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Central University Basic Research Fund of China, (30106200548, CCNU20TS032); Central University Basic Research Fund of China","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (62077017, 61937001, 61977030) and the Central University Basic Research Fund of China (30106200548, CCNU20TS032).","C.M., Academic stress detection on university students during COVID-19 outbreak by using an electronic nose and the galvanic skin response, Biomedical Signal Processing and Control, 68, (2021); L., Biosignals reflect pair-dynamics in collaborative work: EDA and ECG study of pair-programming in a classroom environment, Scientific Reports, 8, 1, (2018); Al-Emran, Mostafa, Evaluating the Use of Smartwatches for Learning Purposes through the Integration of the Technology Acceptance Model and Task-Technology Fit, International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction, 37, 19, pp. 1874-1882, (2021); Almusawi, Hashem A., Innovation in physical education: Teachers’ perspectives on readiness for wearable technology integration, Computers and Education, 167, (2021); Cognitive Psychology and Its Implications, (1990); Antoniou, Panagiotis E., Biosensor real-time affective analytics in virtual and mixed reality medical education serious games: Cohort study, JMIR Serious Games, 8, 3, (2020); A., Reducing Anxiety and Improving Academic Performance Through a Biofeedback Relaxation Training Program, Applied Psychophysiology Biofeedback, 42, 3, pp. 193-202, (2017); I., Wearable learning: Multiplayer embodied games for math, pp. 205-216, (2017); M., LSTM-Based Emotion Detection Using Physiological Signals: IoT Framework for Healthcare and Distance Learning in COVID-19, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 8, 23, pp. 16863-16871, (2021); Allyn and Bacon, (1984)","Y.

Reasons for this change are the increased popularity of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and the disruptions imposed by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. However, it is difficult for teachers to read the room in these virtual classrooms, and researchers have begun to look at using sensors to provide feedback to help inform teaching practices. The study presented here sought to ground classroom sensor data in the form of electrodermal activities (EDA) captured using a wrist-worn sensing platform (Empatica E4), with observations about students' emotional engagement in the class. We collected a dataset from eleven students over eight lectures in college-level computer science classes. We trained human annotators who provided ground truth information about student engagement based on in-class observations. Inspired by related work in the field, we implemented an automated data analysis framework, which we used to explore momentary assessments of student engagement in classrooms. Our findings surprised us because we found no significant correlation between the sensor data and our trained observers' data. In this paper, we present our study and framework for automated engagement assessment, and report on our findings that indicate some of the challenges in deploying current technology for real-world, automated momentary assessment of student engagement in the classroom. We offer reflections on our findings and discuss ways forward toward an automated reading the room approach. © 2022 Owner/Author.","Electrodermal Activity; Engagements; Momentary Assessments; Students; Wearable","Automation; Computer aided instruction; Electrodes; Wearable sensors; Electrodermal activity; Engagement; Learning environments; Massive open online course; Momentary assessment; Sensors data; Student engagement; Teachers'; Virtual class; Wearable; Students","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1842693)","","Unobtrusive Assessment of Student Engagement Levels in Online Classroom Environment Using Emotion Analysis, (2021); Appleton, James J., Student engagement with school: Critical conceptual and methodological issues of the construct, Psychology in the Schools, 45, 5, pp. 369-386, (2008); T.S., Affective database for e-learning and classroom environments using Indian students’ faces, hand gestures and body postures, Future Generation Computer Systems, 108, pp. 334-348, (2020); A., Automatic detection of students’ affective states in classroom environment using hybrid convolutional neural networks, Education and Information Technologies, 25, 2, pp. 1387-1415, (2020); T.S., Impact of inquiry interventions on students in e-learning and classroom environments using affective computing framework, User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction, 30, 5, pp. 759-801, (2020); R., The benefits and caveats of using clickstream data to understand student self-regulatory behaviors: opening the black box of learning processes, International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education, 17, 1, (2020); Bakker, Jorn, What's your current stress level?

The aim of the study was to explore the relationships between local environmental stressors and physiological responses from the perspective of citizen science. Starting from July 2021, data from EEG headsets were complemented by those obtained from smartwatches (namely heart rate and its variability and body temperature and stress score). Identical units of a wearable device containing environmental sensors (such as ambient temperature, air pressure, infrared radiation, and relative humidity) were designed and worn, respectively, by five adolescents for the same period. More than 100,000 data points of different types—neurological, physiological, and environmental—were eventually collected and were processed through a random forest regression model and deep learning models. The results showed that the most influential microclimatic factors on the biometric indicators were noise and the concentrations of carbon dioxide and dust. Subsequently, more complex inferences were made from the Shapley value interpretation of the regression models. Such findings suggest implications for the design of living conditions with respect to the interaction of the microclimate and human health and comfort. © 2022 by the authors.","citizen science; electroencephalography (EEG); environmental data; internet of things; machine learning; mental health; microclimate; physical health; sensors","body temperature; Singapore","","","","","","","Climate Change 2014 Synthesis Report, (2014); Effects of Climate Change; Our World in Data, (2018); J., A multiscale analysis of urbanization effects on ecosystem services supply in an urban megaregion, Science of the Total Environment, 662, pp. 824-833, (2019); Y., A review on the CFD analysis of urban microclimate, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 80, pp. 1613-1640, (2017); Microclimates What are They and Why do We have Them Spectrumnews1, (2021); D., Methodology of photic stimulation revisited: Updated European algorithm for visual stimulation in the EEG laboratory, Epilepsia, 53, 1, pp. 16-24, (2012); M.J., The effect of noise exposure on cognitive performance and brain activity patterns, Open Access Macedonian Journal of Medical Sciences, 7, 17, pp. 2924-2931, (2019); X., EEG Based Stress Monitoring, pp. 3110-3115, (2016); I., Effects of Heart Rate Variability Biofeedback on EEG Alpha Asymmetry and Anxiety Symptoms in Male Athletes: A Pilot Study, Applied Psychophysiology Biofeedback, 41, 2, pp. 141-150, (2016)","K.Y.T.

This technology includes the now pervasive presence of the Internet, but also the inclusion of devices that are worn by teachers and learners. Wearable devices have greatly facilitated data acquisition of educational subjects. This article provides an overview of what and how wearable devices have been used in education and in what contexts. Summaries of existing research in this area are organized according to a three-layered data framework. We begin by presenting the technical characteristics of four types of wearable devices, and comparing the data from them with physiological data and behavioral data. Based on this, the preprocessing and analysis methods of these two types of data are discussed. Following that, we identified the six main applications that wearables and data analytics are enabling education. Furthermore, three key challenges of using wearable devices have been identified. We suggest that future research should be enriched from equipment innovation, application scenarios, and feedback methods in order to make wearable devices more widely used in a production environment, and augment the analysis performed to improve teaching, learning, or the educational context where it occurs. © 2014 IEEE.","Artificial intelligence; Internet of Things; smart education; wearable devices","Data reduction; Electroencephalography; Electrophysiology; Internet of things; Teaching; Wearable technology; Artificial intelligence.; Behavioral data; Biomedical monitoring; Data framework; Integral part; Physiological data; Smart education; Teachers'; Wearable computing; Wearable devices; Data acquisition","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61807012); Central University Basic Research Fund of China, (CCNU20QN027)","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61807012, and in part by the Central University Basic Research Fund of China under Grant CCNU20QN027.","M.I., Enabling IoT in Education 4.0 with BioSensors from Wearables and Artificial Intelligence, pp. 17-24, (2019); D., A quantitative approach for evaluating the quality of experience of smart-wearables from the quality of data and quality of information: An end user perspective, IEEE Access, 7, pp. 64266-64278, (2019); Themes in Elearning, (2020); A., Associating Facial Expressions and Upper-Body Gestures with Learning Tasks for Enhancing Intelligent Tutoring Systems, International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, 30, 2, pp. 236-270, (2020); Y., A framework for learning analytics using commodity wearable devices, Sensors, 17, 6, (2017); V., Use of wearable devices to study activity of children in classroom; Case study — Learning geometry using movement, Computer Communications, 150, pp. 581-588, (2020); Y., Recent developments in sensors for wearable device applications, Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry, 413, 24, pp. 6037-6057, (2021); K., Evolution of wearable devices with real-time disease monitoring for personalized healthcare, Nanomaterials, 9, 6, (2019); M., The world through Glass: developing novel methods with wearable computing for urban videographic research, Journal of Geography in Higher Education, 39, 2, pp. 275-287, (2015); G., Deploying a wearable computing platform for computing education, IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies, 3, 1, pp. 45-55, (2010)","Q.

Several studies have attempted to classify these deficits with the application of machine learning in anatomical brain imaging, rendering the classification techniques using EEG graph measures both robust and reliable. In this paper, a classification of university students with and without dyslexia is attempted with the use of a Brain Computer Interface (BCI) Device and an Interactive Linguistic Software Tool in order to validate the application of such a device in classifying dyslexia in a higher education population. EEG signals acquired from a wearable, sensory EEG recording device from 12 university students with dyslexia along with 14 typically developed, age matched individuals are recorded, while participants were examined in three different experimental conditions: a) auditory discrimination, b) visual recognition c) visual recognition with background music. Spectral features extracted from each EEG rhythm (δ, θ, α, β, γ) are used to train a Random Forests classifier, aiming to identify quantitative EEG features that characterize dyslexia in different brain regions. Results show high levels of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity (above 95%) in the entire brain, followed by the left and right hemisphere, with the highest discrimination performance reported during the third experimental condition with the presence of background music. Different experimental conditions provide high classification accuracy that results in correct discrimination between higher education students with and without dyslexia. © 2022","Brain Computer Interface; Dyslexia; EEG; Learning disorders; Random Forests; Wearable device","Application programs; Brain; Brain computer interface; Brain mapping; Classification (of information); Students; Wearable technology; Dyslexium; EEG signals; Experimental conditions; Interface devices; Learning disorder; Random forests; Software-tools; University students; Visual recognition; Wearable devices; Decision trees; accuracy; adult; Article; auditory discrimination; Bayesian learning; clinical article; controlled study; decision tree; diagnostic test accuracy study; dyslexia; electroencephalogram; feature extraction; female; human; k nearest neighbor; male; random forest; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity and specificity; support vector machine; visual memory","","","","","European Commission, EC; European Regional Development Fund, ERDF","We acknowledge support of this work by the project “Immersive Virtual, Augmented and Mixed Reality Center Of Epirus” (MIS:5047221) which is implemented under the Action “Reinforcement of the Research and Innovation Infrastructure”, funded by the Operational Programme “Competitiveness, Entrepreneurship and Innovation” (NSRF 2014-2020) and co-financed by Greece and the European Union (European Regional Development Fund).","I.S., A cross-sectional study to assess the prevalence of DSM-5 specific learning disorders in representative school samples from the second to sixth grade in Brazil, European Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 25, 2, pp. 195-207, (2016); Habib, Michel, The neurological basis of developmental dyslexia an overview and working hypothesis, Brain, 123, 12, pp. 2373-2399, (2000); F., Developmental dyslexia: The difficulties of interpreting poor performance, and the importance of normal performance, Cognitive Neuropsychology, 29, 1-2, pp. 104-122, (2012); Icd 10 Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Guidelines, (1993); undefined, (2013); Snowling, Margaret J., From Language to Reading and Dyslexia, Dyslexia, 7, 1, pp. 37-46, (2001); E., Dyslexia: Cultural diversity and biological unity, Science, 291, 5511, pp. 2165-2167, (2001); F., Theories of developmental dyslexia: Insights from a multiple case study of dyslexic adults, Brain, 126, 4, pp. 841-865, (2003); Vellutino, Frank R., Specific reading disability (dyslexia): What have we learned in the past four decades?, Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry and Allied Disciplines, 45, 1, pp. 2-40, (2004); S.E., Dyslexia (specific reading disability), Biological Psychiatry, 57, 11, pp. 1301-1309, (2005)","A.T.

The sleep diary is essential for behavior therapy and sleep hygiene education. However, limitations include subjectivity and laborious input. We aimed to develop an artificial intelligence sleep prediction model and to find factors associated with good sleep using a wrist-worn actigraphy device. Methods: We enrolled 109 participants who reported having no sleep disturbances. We developed a sleep prediction model using 733 days of actigraphy data of physical activity and light exposure. Twenty-four sleep prediction models were developed based on different data sources (actigraphy alone, sleep diary alone, or combined data), different durations of data (1 or 2 days), and different analysis methods (extreme gradient boosting, convolutional neural network, long short-term memory, logistic regression analysis). The outcome measure of “good sleep” was defined as ≥ 90% sleep efficiency. Results: Actigraphy model performance was comparable to sleep diary model performance. Two-day models generally performed better than 1-day models. Among all models, the 2-day, combined (actigraphy and sleep diary), extreme gradient boosting model had the best performance for predicting good sleep (accuracy = 0.69, area under the curve = 0.70).

Since social-emotional learning may be defined as a vital component of the learning process in professional instructional design practices, online learners not only need to develop the ability to apply their knowledge, attitudes, and skills but also to understand and manage their emotions. In which setting and achieving positive goals through social interaction, sharing feelings, and developing empathy for others can help with the process. This paper outlines the possibility of using emotion recognition, and social sharing of emotion techniques to support the regulation of emotion in pre-service teacher education. This study aimed to investigate pre-service teachers’ emotion recognition tools acquired by emotion tracker and physiological signals based on their perceptions (without a concrete experience and knowledge). Moreover, the predictive ability was examined along with the relationships between emotion recognition, social sharing of emotion, and emotion regulation. Finally, we investigated emotion adjustment techniques that can be adapted into mobile computer-supported collaborative learning (mCSCL). In this study, 183 pre-service teachers from three different teacher-education institutions in Thailand, were voluntarily participated based on convenience sampling. The results of a self-report via online survey revealed that most pre-service teachers own at least one of the mobile technologies e.g., smartphones, tablets, or laptops. However, there is an increasing number of additional gadgets and wearable devices like EarPods and smartwatches. At the current time, it is nearly impossible to use of the IoT and other wearable devices. According to their subjective impressions in which corresponded to emotion recognition in the scientific literature, Heart rate (HR) and Heart rate variability (HRV) have recognized the most possibilities for emotion detection among physiological signals. Regarding regression analysis, the two-predictor models of emotion recognition and the social sharing of emotion were also able to account for 31% of the variance in emotion regulation, p<.001, R2=.31, and 95% CI [.70, .77]. In addition, the mCSCL applications and the importance of these variables in different collaboration levels are also discussed. © The Authors.","Emotion recognition; Emotion regulation; MCSCL; Social emotional learning; Social sharing of emotion","","","","","","Thailand Research Fund, TRF, (PHD/0210/2560); Thailand Research Fund, TRF","Author contributions: SW: Original draft, formal analysis, writing, review, and editing; JN-S: Review and editing.

This plays a very negative role on their minds along with physical laziness and obesity. The proposed system that solves this issue uses virtual reality gaming interface and activity recognition system for the users to play outdoor games in their rooms. People can wear the headsets along with wearables and can enjoy 3D games while exercising. The system uses sensors (MPU6050) connected with nRF24L01 modules and Arduino responsible for sending the sensor data to the game. Moreover, the data by sensor is processed using a machine learning model, which predicts the game played by the user. The proposed system aims at recognizing six basic games in the IMSporting behaviors dataset, which utilizes triaxial accelerometers connected to the subject's knee, wrist, and below neck areas to capture human activities i.e., badminton, basketball, table tennis, skipping, cycling and football. WISDM dataset is used to recognize activities such as jogging and walking. The system has achieved an accuracy of 92% by using median filter as a pre-processing technique, Fourier transform features extraction and artificial neural networks classifier. The system can be applied to many fields like education, offices, construction and sports.

To enhance the performance of collaborative learning, the studies in Yamaguchi et al. (2021, 2021, 2021, and 2022) develop an IoT system and quantitatively extract collaboration between learners. The studies acquire sensor data from IoT badges on learners and analyze learning activities with the acquired sensor data on a computer. However, existing studies are not user-friendly for learning analysts who are unfamiliar with information technology owing to complex software installation and command line interface (CLI) operation. Such drawbacks hinder the wide expansion of technology and the exploration of new learning patterns in learning science. Considering high usability for analysts, this paper proposes novel web services named Sensor-based Regulation Profiler Web Services (SRP Web Services) for collaboration analysis with IoT badges.

However, in more practical online learning scenarios, where new data arrive sequentially, neural networks suffer severely from the 'catastrophic forgetting' problem. In real-world settings, given a pre-trained model on the old data, when we collect new data, it is practically infeasible to re-train the model on both old and new data because the computational costs will increase dramatically as more and more data arrive in time. However, if we fine-tune the model only with the new data because the new data might be different from the old data, the neural network parameters will change to fit the new data. As a result, the new parameters are no longer suitable for the old data. This phenomenon is known as catastrophic forgetting, and continual learning research aims to overcome this problem with minimal computational costs. While most of the continual learning research focuses on computer vision tasks, implications of catastrophic forgetting in wearable computing research and potential avenues to address this problem have remained unexplored. To address this knowledge gap, we study continual learning for activity recognition using wearable sensor data. We show that the catastrophic forgetting problem is a critical challenge for real-world deployment of machine learning models for wearables. Moreover, we show that the catastrophic forgetting problem can be alleviated by employing various training techniques. © 2022 IEEE.","","Deep neural networks; Learning systems; Pattern recognition; Activity recognition; Catastrophic forgetting; Catastrophic forgetting problem; Computational costs; Continual learning; Learning scenarios; Online learning; Practical online; Prediction tasks; Sensors data; Wearable sensors; education; knowledge; machine learning; Education, Distance; Knowledge; Machine Learning; Neural Networks, Computer; Recognition, Psychology","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (CNS-1750679, CNS-1932346, CNS-2210133, IIS-1852163, IIS-1954372); National Science Foundation, NSF","This work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation, under grants CNS-1750679, IIS-1852163, CNS-1932346, CNS-2210133, and IIS-1954372.

A visual knowledge graph was used to streamline the countries, institutions and authors conducting sports AI research, discipline distribution, research hotspots and development trends in the past 15 years. Subsequently, its development direction and research progress were discussed. Sports AI was widely distributed, with the US, China and the UK leading the way. The most prolific authors and teams in research on sports AI were concentrated in American universities. Their main research direction is to develop and improve smart wearable devices based on machine learning and deep learning technologies for different groups of people. Research on sports AI involved multiple disciplines, which mainly applied and referred to research methodologies and theories on engineering, computer science and sports science. It could be seen from the frequency and centrality of keywords that in the current field of sports AI, machine learning is the main direction, artificial neural networks is the main algorithm, and practical and empirical research based on data mining is the focus. The research hotspots were divided into three major clusters: physical health promotion, sports injury prevention and control, and athletic performance enhancement.

The problem faced by people today is that they are more indulged in indoor technology rather than outdoor activities. Hence, the proposed system introduces a fitness solution connecting virtual reality with a gaming interface so that an individual can play first-person games. The system proposed in this paper is an efficient and cost-effective solution that can entertain people along with playing outdoor games such as badminton and cricket while sitting in the room. To track the human movement, sensors Micro Processor Unit (MPU6050) are used that are connected with Bluetooth modules and Arduino responsible for sending the sensor data to the game. Further, the sensor data is sent to a machine learning model, which detects the game played by the user. The detected game will be operated on human gestures. A publicly available dataset named IM-Sporting Behaviors is initially used, which utilizes triaxial accelerometers attached to the subject’s wrist, knee, and below neck regions to capture important aspects of human motion. The main objective is that the person is enjoying while playing the game and simultaneously is engaged in some kind of sporting activity. The proposed system uses artificial neural networks classifier giving an accuracy of 88.9%. The proposed system should apply to many systems such as construction, education, offices and the educational sector. Extensive experimentation proved the validity of the proposed system. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

In order to realize the online monitoring of wearable devices with artificial intelligence in sports and overcome the problem of low recognition accuracy of electrocardiogram, blood oxygen, and respiratory signals in many cases, this paper proposes a combination of variational modal decomposition based on the maximum envelope kurtosis method. Long-short-term neural network (VMD-LSTM) monitoring method for wearable sports equipment. Through experimental analysis and verification, the current signal of the VMD model shows a trend of fluctuating from large to stable and then to large with motion, while the training accuracy of LSTM after the 150th iteration is 94.09%, which shows that the coupling model VMD LSTM can better predict the direction of sports artificial intelligence. In addition, although the training time of the BP neural network is shorter than that of the LSTM model, there is a large gap between the recognition effect and the LSTM, and there are also large differences between different neural network structures. This shows that the VMD-LSTM model has broad application prospects in such models. © 2022 Tiancong Zhang and Caihua Fu.","","Electrocardiograms; Engineering education; Iterative methods; Knowledge management; Long short-term memory; Wearable technology; Artificial intelligence technologies; Key Issues; Knowledge transfer; Online monitoring; Physical education; Recognition accuracy; Time-space; Traditional models; Transfer method; Wearable devices; Sports; artificial intelligence; motion; sport; Artificial Intelligence; Motion; Neural Networks, Computer","","","","","","","X., Research of freight intelligent detection and contingency command system, Applied Mechanics and Materials, 263-266, PART 1, pp. 2829-2833, (2013); T.-H., Semantically conditioned lstm-based Natural language generation for spoken dialogue systems, pp. 1711-1721, (2015); Z., Research on Fault Diagnosis Method of Train Rolling Bearing Based on Variational Modal Decomposition and Bat Algorithm-Support Vector Machine, Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 1820, 1, (2021); F., Xception: Deep learning with depthwise separable convolutions, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2017-January, pp. 1800-1807, (2017); L., Adaptive weights learning in CNN feature fusion for crime scene investigation image classification, Connection Science, 33, 3, pp. 719-734, (2021); X., Research on the Training Strategy of Aerobic Physical Education Talents under the Background of Artificial Intelligence Era, Applied Bionics and Biomechanics, 2022, (2022); J., Skeleton-Based Action Recognition Using Spatio-Temporal LSTM Network with Trust Gates, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 40, 12, pp. 3007-3021, (2018); J., Cognitive analysis in sports: Supporting match analysis and scouting through artificial intelligence, Applied AI Letters, 2, 1, (2021); X., Multi-domain extreme learning machine for bearing failure detection based on variational modal decomposition and approximate cyclic correntropy, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 197711-197729, (2020); X.-M., Modal Analysis of a Bridge during High-Speed Train Passages by Enhanced Variational Mode Decomposition, International Journal of Structural Stability and Dynamics, 20, 13, (2020)","C.

A digital twin is a computerized representation of the physical object or phenomenon, which acts as its real-time digital equivalent. Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly widespread, and museums and art shows will need to change their old working and thinking processes to fully fulfill their potential. In an increasingly digital world, combining AI technologies and wearable devices into digital museums could assist in boosting involvement. It is necessary to investigate AI's strategic function and application in affecting tourist experiences at art galleries and museums, as well as its potential to improve education. Also, digital twin (DT) paves the way to alleviate difficulties or might improve access to digital museums via digital experiences. The historical report recommends that digital museum items be represented in a way that poses the fewest threats to its legitimacy. Owing to its uniqueness and vulnerability to substantial environmental dangers, the safeguarding of art and cultural heritage in digital museums is a serious issue. There are many approaches for assessing the state of artistic heritage and protecting it from extreme acts. The current study offers a framework for digitized museum art design based on the utilization of digital twin (DT), artificial intelligence (AI), and fifth-generation (5G) technologies. Further to enhance the security of the system, we employ the improved blowfish encryption algorithm (IBEA). Also, the authentication is done using the Diffie-Hellman protocol. The proposed system is simulated using MATLAB, and its performance is analyzed and compared with conventional systems. From the result obtained, it was revealed that the suggested methodology express high range of security level (95%) than the existing mechanisms. This study is very important in two directions: (1) it presents an analytical structure for having to adapt digital information to complicated systems in museums and (2) it explains the artistic obstacles for heritage properties, such as accessibility, execution time, security level, and the efficiency of 3-dimensional designs. © 2022 Jing Zhao et al.","","5G mobile communication systems; Artificial intelligence; Cryptography; Museums; Wearable technology; Arts designs; Digital equivalents; Digital museums; Digital world; Physical objects; Physical phenomena; Real- time; Security level; Thinking process; Working process; Digital devices","","","","","","","Analysis on the Development Trend and Application Technology of Digital Museum, (2019); Research on Ui Visual Design of Intangible Cultural Heritage Digital Museum Based on User Experience; C., Design and Communication of Digital Museum Based on Computer and Internet Technology, Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 1578, 1, (2020); Z., The development and performance evaluation of digital museums towards second classroom of primary and secondary school - Taking Zhejiang Education Technology Digital Museum as an example, International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning, 14, 2, pp. 69-84, (2019); Z.-H., Research on the Application of Internet of Things Technology to Digital Museum Construction, Acta Geoscientica Sinica, 38, 2, pp. 293-298, (2017); Digital Museum and User Experience the Case of Google Art Culture, (2019); I., Does digital technology improve the visitor experience?

The objective of this paper is to find out what kinds of technical applications (such as wearable sensors) and how they can be applied in sports games as well as in physical exercises. In reality, up to now there are many researches and interests in the field of robotics interaction (this is new trend) with the meanings to recognize athletes or human activity, i.e., identifying type of activity of human, from the received signal stream (image, accelerometer, etc.). In this field there are at least two various methods to classify problem of activity recognition. And this is depending on whether machine learning models with recognition or the type of sensor is used to collect signals of activity. Study showed that to observe human or athletes activities to increase recognition efficiency, people are simultaneously observed by environmental cameras while still wearing accelerometers. Digital technology can also be applied for coaching athletes. Moreover, the camera could be worn in several different locations on the body such as on the chest, wrists, and head. The combination of wearing multiple sensors has also been conducted for specific applications (care and monitoring of health progress and assessment of recovery) which can be used in sport games.

Although recent work has demonstrated significant relationships between mental effort and physiological data such as skin temperature, heart rate, and electrodermal activity, we have yet to demonstrate their efficacy for the forecasting of mental effort such that a useful mental effort tracker can be developed. Given prior difficulty in extracting relationships between mental effort and physiological responses that are repeatable across individuals, we make the case that fusing self-report measures with physiological data within an internet or smartphone application may provide an effective method for training a useful mental effort tracking system. In this case study, we utilized over 90 h of data from a single participant over the course of a college semester. By fusing the participant’s self-reported mental effort in different activities over the course of the semester with concurrent physiological data collected with the Empatica E4 wearable sensor, we explored questions around how much data were needed to train such a device, and which types of machine-learning algorithms worked best. We concluded that although baseline models such as logistic regression and Markov models provided useful explanatory information on how the student’s physiology changed with mental effort, deep-learning algorithms were able to generate accurate predictions using the first 28 h of data for training. A system that combines long short-term memory and convolutional neural networks is recommended in order to generate smooth predictions while also being able to capture transitions in mental effort when they occur in the individual using the device. © 2021 by the authors.","cognitive load; deep learning; learning analytics; mental effort; wearable sensor","","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1742339)","J.G. was supported by the National Science Foundation under grant no. 1742339.","K., Effects of Motivational Interviewing and Wearable Fitness Trackers on Motivation and Physical Activity: A Systematic Review, American Journal of Health Promotion, 35, 2, pp. 226-235, (2021); K.-J., Consumer-based wearable activity trackers increase physical activity participation: Systematic review and meta-analysis, JMIR mHealth and uHealth, 7, 4, (2019); F.L., The Promise and Perils of Wearable Physiological Sensors for Diabetes Management, Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology, 12, 3, pp. 587-591, (2018); C., Mobile and wearable technology for the monitoring of diabetes-related parameters: Systematic review, JMIR mHealth and uHealth, 9, 6, (2021); Z.X., Applying deep learning and wearable devices for educational data analytics, 2019-November, pp. 871-878, (2019); Z.X., A sophisticated platform for learning analytics with wearable devices, pp. 300-304, (2020); R., The Effect of Physical Activity Interventions Comprising Wearables and Smartphone Applications on Physical Activity: a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis, Sports Medicine - Open, 4, 1, (2018); T., Use of Wearable Activity Trackers to Improve Physical Activity Behavior in Patients With Rheumatic and Musculoskeletal Diseases: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis, Arthritis Care and Research, 71, 6, pp. 758-767, (2019); R.M., Towards building a computer aided education system for special students using wearable sensor technologies, Sensors, 17, 2, (2017); J.-M., Smart interactive education system based on wearable devices, Sensors, 19, 15, (2019)","W.

Due to many technological, cultural and health related changes (such as Covid 19 pandemic), the means for managing attendance has been transformed with Internet of Things (IoT) based technologies. Attendance management system (AMS) is a system that documents and keeps track of employee and student hours and stores them on local repository or in the cloud. Manual approach to recording and keeping track of attendance is prone to human errors and time consuming. Although many studies have proposed new IoT biometric based solutions to enhance this process, achieving accuracy, efficiency and expense affordability can be a challenging task. The most used biometric approach recently is face recognition IoT solutions. Face recognition can be challenging during the Covid 19 pandemic because of face masks. Taking these issues into consideration, we propose a GPS-enabled Iris-based biometric approach for the attendance management system with smartwatches' compatibility feature. The system performs two main tasks: identification and real time localization. The identification is achieved with iris-based identification while localization is using GPS technology and smart watches. The proposed system addresses many fundamental issues such as the expense factors of manufacturing dedicated tracking wearable devices. It also provides an efficient means of identification using iris-based biometric identification which provides many advantages such as accuracy and enhanced friendly experience without relying on face recognition. The proposed IoT Attendance management systems will be designed to provide better automation for managing attendance and reduce many human errors resulting from manual approaches. © 2021 ACM.","Attendance management system (AMS); Biometrics; Internet of Things (IoT); Iris-based recognition","Engineering education; Errors; Face recognition; Internet of things; Wearable computers; Attendance management system; Attendance management systems; Biometric-based solutions; Face masks; Human errors; Internet of thing; Iris-based recognition; Keep track of; Main tasks; Technological evolution; Biometrics","","","","","Prince Sultan University, PSU","The authors would like to acknowledge the support of Prince Sultan University for paying the Article Processing Charges (APC) of this publication.","S.A., A high-efficiency energy and storage approach for IoT applications of facial recognition, Image and Vision Computing, 96, (2020); Michael, Katina, The emerging ethics of humancentric GPS tracking and monitoring, (2006); M., Adopting Internet of Things for the development of smart buildings: A review of enabling technologies and applications, Automation in Construction, 101, pp. 111-126, (2019); J.P., IAAS: IoT-Based Automatic Attendance System with Photo Face Recognition in Smart Campus, International Conference on ICT Convergence, 2020-October, pp. 363-366, (2020); A., The role of digital technology in responding to COVID-19 pandemic: Saudi Arabia’s experience, Risk Management and Healthcare Policy, 14, pp. 3923-3934, (2021); Data Science Applications in Pandemic A Survey on Covid 19 Outbreak Tools, (2021); Current practice of using technology in health-care delivery in saudi arabia: Challenges and solutions, 15, 1, pp. 1-7; Biometric Based Wearable User Authentication During Sedentary and Non Sedentary Periods, (2018); N.D., Data for life: Wearable technology and the design of self-care, BioSocieties, 11, 3, pp. 317-333, (2016); W., Biometrics for internet‐of‐things security: A review, Sensors, 21, 18, (2021)","S.

Auditory and visual technologies have been fully developed and utilized, while as an emerging field, tactile sense is a research direction with great potential. As a type of unique human sensory channel, tactile sense has unique advantages. It can convey information about maximum joints in physiological structure of human body, such as hardness, texture, shape, size, and temperature, which cannot be transmitted by visual and auditory senses. Additionally, the tactile sense is fast and accurate, thus, it performs well in some special situations, such as supergravity scenarios, high-speed rotating scenarios, or very noisy environments. The design of vibrational tactile coding is an important way to develop tactile devices and achieve a better human computer interaction. Haptic coding has several defects. It is used in narrow application scenes and conveys unclear meaning. Compared with the mature development of vision and hearing, it is necessary to further design the vibration haptic coding patterns to overcome these defects. Research on information transmission of tactile sense is very meaningful, for example, it offers convenience for special groups such as people with visual impairment or workers engaged in their education. It provides a navigation service for visually impaired people by changing the vibration frequency and vibration intensity of a blind vest. When hearing or vision is impaired, the tactile sense is a considerate way to provide timely and accurate information assistance to the special groups. Besides, tactile sense can help express the flight attitude information in virtue of combined vibration tactile coding. However, these studies aimed at providing a set of specific coding for a specific scenario in which relatively vague pieces of information were conveyed, such as emotion and direction Based on these studies, designing a set of universal coding patterns for most usage scenarios to deliver exact and accessible information is essential. This paper discussed the resolution of tactile vibration based on the mechanism of tactile vibration perception. According to the application of directional navigation and text interaction, the vibration information coding was summarized and the experimental methods and conclusions of vibration information coding were introduced.

In order to further improve students’ physical quality and motor skills, the traditional model was improved to address the lack of accuracy in motion recognition and detection of physical condition so as to assist teachers to improve students’ physical quality. First, the physical education teaching activities required by the new curriculum reform were studied with regard to the actual needs of China’s current social, political, and economic development; next, the application of artificial intelligence technology to physical education teaching activities was proposed; and finally, deep learning technology was studied and a human movement recognition model based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network was established to identify the movement state of students in physical education teaching activities. The designed model includes three components: Data acquisition, data calculation, and data visualization. The functions of each layer were introduced; then, the intelligent wearable system was adopted to detect the status of students and a feedback system was established to assist teaching; and finally, the dataset was constructed to train and test the designed model. The experimental results demonstrate that the recognition accuracy and loss value of the training model meet the practical requirements; in the algorithm test, the motion recognition accuracy of the designed model for different subjects was greater than 97.5%. Compared with the traditional human motion recognition algorithm, the designed model had a better recognition effect. Hence, the designed model can meet the actual needs of physical education. This exploration provides a new perspective for promoting the intelligent development of physical education. © 2021 by the authors.

Regarding the effects of background music on learning tasks, results are inconclusive in the literature. Recent advancement of wearable devices and computing analytics supports automated detection of multimodal physiological signals, such as eye movements, neural responses, and heart rates in a real-time fashion, which can facilitate tracking learners' changes of affect, attention, and cognition while they study with the accompaniment of background music. However, most existing studies focus only on behavioral levels, and few employed signals at physiological levels to investigate the impact of background music on learning. To fill in the research gap, this doctoral project designs two types of visual cognitive tasks, that is, reading comprehension task and art appreciation task. It aims to integrate multimodal data (e.g., eye movements, electroencephalogram (EEG), and peripheral physiological signals) to probe the effect of background music on the tasks. Its findings will extend our knowledge on the interactions among learners' performance, emotion, and engagement at both physiological and behavioral levels in multi-channel learning settings, and contribute to a goal of recommending suitable background music for self-learning. © 2021 IEEE.","Emotion; Eye-tracking; Mental workload; Multimodal data analysis; Music for learning; Neural responses; Peripheral Physiological signals","Electroencephalography; Physiological models; Automated detection; Background musics; Electro-encephalogram (EEG); Learning settings; Multi-modal learning; Physiological levels; Physiological signals; Reading comprehension; Eye movements","","","","","","","E., The effects of background music on learning: a systematic review of literature to guide future research and practice, Educational Technology Research and Development, 68, 6, pp. 2817-2837, (2020); Music Perception, (2002); G.D., A review of research and a meta-analysis of the seductive detail effect, Educational Research Review, 7, 3, pp. 216-237, (2012); X., Can background music facilitate learning?

The recent advent of affordable wearable sensors has considerably expanded the range of these possibilities to fields such as computer gaming, education, entertainment, health, neuro-marketing, psychology, etc. The Visual Attention Software by 3M (3M-VAS) is an artificial intelligence application that was formulated using experimental data from eye-tracking. It can be used to predict viewer reactions to images, generating fixation point probability maps and fixation point sequence estimations, thus revealing pre-attentive processing of visual stimuli with a very high de-gree of accuracy. We have used 3M-VAS software in an innovative implementation to analyze images of different buildings, either in their original state or photographically manipulated, as well as various geometric patterns. The software not only reveals non-obvious fixation points, but also overall relative design coherence, a key element of Christopher Alexander’s theory of geometrical order. A more evenly distributed field of attention seen in some structures contrasts with other buildings being ignored, those showing instead unconnected points of splintered attention. Our findings are non-intuitive and surprising. We link these results to both Alexander’s theory and Neu-roscience, identify potential pitfalls in the software’s use, and also suggest ways to avoid them. © 2021 by the authors.

Aiming at addressing the problems of poor portability of the devices, single sort of physiological signals, and excessively subjective evaluation of attentiveness in current monitoring systems, this paper designed an attentiveness evaluation system based on multiple physiological information. First of all, in view of the large volume of traditional acquisition devices, we designed the miniaturized, wearable multi-physiological signal acquisition node. Based on a single-channel EEG signal analog acquisition front-end, 9-axis acceleration acquisition chip and blood oxygen (SpO2) acquisition module, we acquired the EEG, posture and SpO2 signals synchronously. Secondly, in the light of the bandwidth and power consumption of information transmission in the wireless body area network, we designed a data transmission networking based on wireless radio frequency Wi-Fi, achieving high-speed signal communication with high accuracy. The attentiveness induction experiment was designed, and an objective evaluation index of attentiveness based on reaction time and accuracy rate for regression analysis and fitting was put forward. After preprocessing the raw data, a variety of features were extracted, and the performance of the attentiveness evaluation was verified. Results show that the accuracy rate of the attentiveness is up to 77.1%, which realizes the effective evaluation of attentiveness. © 2021 IEEE.","attemtiveness; biosensing technologies; multi-physiological parameters; wearable device","Artificial intelligence; Monitoring; Physiology; Radio transmission; Signal processing; Wearable technology; Wi-Fi; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Current monitoring systems; Human-machine collaboration; Information transmission; Physiological informations; Physiological parameters; Physiological signal acquisitions; Wireless body area network; Wireless radio-frequency; Physiological models","","","","","(2016RALGJ001); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NNSFC, (61301012, 61471140)","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work was sponsored by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61301012, No. 61471140), and Sci-tech Innovation Foundation of Harbin (No. 2016RALGJ001).","B., The BCI competition 2003: Progress and perspectives in detection and discrimination of EEG single trials, IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering, 51, 6, pp. 1044-1051, (2004); Shen, Kaiquan, EEG-based mental fatigue measurement using multi-class support vector machines with confidence estimate, Clinical Neurophysiology, 119, 7, pp. 1524-1533, (2008); Y., A clip-free eyeglasses-based wearable monitoring device for measuring photoplethysmograhic signals, Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology - Proceedings, pp. 5022-5025, (2012); Sokwoo, Modeling of finger photoplethysmography for wearable sensors, Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology - Proceedings, 2, (1999); B., Wireless communication of vital signs using the georgia tech wearable motherboard, III/WEDNESDAY, pp. 1253-1256, (2000); R., A wearable health care system based on knitted integrated sensors, IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine, 9, 3, pp. 337-344, (2005); W.-Y., A wireless sensor network compatible wearable U-healthcare monitoring system using integrated ECG, accelerometer and SpO2, pp. 1529-1532, (2008); J., Reliability and validity of the Zephyr™ BioHarness™ to measure respiratory responses to exercise, Measurement in Physical Education and Exercise Science, 15, 4, pp. 293-300, (2011); Aeroengine, (2004); G.-D., Wearable system for continuously monitoring physiological parameters, Jilin Daxue Xuebao (Gongxueban)/Journal of Jilin University (Engineering and Technology Edition), 41, 3, pp. 771-775, (2011)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2021 IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Computer Applications, ICAICA 2021","2021-06-28 through 2021-06-30","Dalian","171194","","9781665418676","","","English","IEEE Int.

Past research has demonstrated the capability of mobile sensing to model aspects of physical health, mental health, education, and work performance, etc. However, most of the algorithms and models proposed in previous work follow a one-size-fits-all (i.e., population modeling) approach that looks for common behaviors amongst all users, disregarding the fact that individuals can behave very differently, resulting in reduced model performance. Further, black-box models are often used that do not allow for interpretability and human behavior understanding. We present a new method to address the problems of personalized behavior classification and interpretability, and apply it to depression detection among college students. Inspired by the idea of collaborative-filtering, our method is a type of memory-based learning algorithm. It leverages the relevance of mobile-sensed behavior features among individuals to calculate personalized relevance weights, which are used to impute missing data and select features according to a specific modeling goal (e.g., whether the student has depressive symptoms) in different time epochs, i.e., times of the day and days of the week. It then compiles features from epochs using majority voting to obtain the final prediction. We apply our algorithm on a depression detection dataset collected from first-year college students with low data-missing rates and show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art machine learning model by 5.1% in accuracy and 5.5% in F1 score. We further verify the pipeline-level generalizability of our approach by achieving similar results on a second dataset, with an average improvement of 3.4% across performance metrics. Beyond achieving better classification performance, our novel approach is further able to generate personalized interpretations of the models for each individual. These interpretations are supported by existing depression-related literature and can potentially inspire automated and personalized depression intervention design in the future. © 2021 ACM.","Behavior mining; Depression detection; Passive sensing; Personalization","Behavioral research; Collaborative filtering; Education computing; Machine learning; Students; Behavior classification; Classification performance; Data missing rate; Depressive symptom; Human behavior understanding; Machine learning models; Memory-based learning; Performance metrics; Learning algorithms","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (EDA-2009977, IIS7974751); National Science Foundation, NSF; Google; University of Washington, UW; National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research, NIDILRR, (90DPGE0003-01); National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research, NIDILRR","This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant Number IIS7974751 and EDA-2009977, the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living and Rehabilitation Research under Grant Number 90DPGE0003-01, Carnegie Mellon University Office of the Provost, University of Washington College of Engineering, Department of Electrical Engineering, and School of Computer Science & Engineering, Samsung Research America, and Google.","S., Towards population scale activity recognition: A framework for handling data diversity, Proceedings of the National Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2, pp. 851-857, (2012); Undergraduate Student Reference Group Data Report Spring 2019, (2019); Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases, (1994); Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive Mobile Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies, (2019); American Psychiatric Pub, (2013); Atkeson, Christopher G., Locally Weighted Learning, Artificial Intelligence Review, 11, 1-5, pp. 11-73, (1997); M.S.H., Leveraging Multi-Modal Sensing for Mobile Health: A Case Review in Chronic Pain, IEEE Journal on Selected Topics in Signal Processing, 10, 5, pp. 962-974, (2016); Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive Mobile Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies, (2017); San Antonio, (1996); D., Next-Generation psychiatric assessment: using smartphone sensors to monitor behavior and mental health, Psychiatric Rehabilitation Journal, 38, 3, pp. 218-226, (2015)","","","Association for Computing Machinery","","","","","","","","","","English","Proc.

According to a recent report published by the WHO, over 8 million of people attempt suicide around the year every year, which means in every 40 seconds 1 person commits suicide among them, and 60% of suicidal deaths are caused by depression. Depression is such a silent killer that a person can’t even be aware of his depressive status. Also, some additional factors like our mental and societal barriers sojourn us from going to a psychologist’s chamber for a consultancy. Moreover, the depressive symbols are not always very explicit. Today, with the highly emerging use of IoT and machine learning technologies in every corner of our lives, this field also has witnessed some rays of hope. This chapter covers the aspect of different sensors and IoT devices that are being used for detection of mental health problems from some of our words, expressions or body languages. This chapter has been segmented in mainly three parts: The first part is for the basic understanding of the depression status and their types, next part discusses about literature survey to identify the gap between the current scenario and the future roadmap, and the other important segment discusses about different sensor devices which are being used in this area.

We designed a device that recognizes the time and interval of urination based on the patient’s spe-cific posture and posture changes. The technology used for recognition applied the Radial Basis Function kernel-based Support Vector Ma-chine, a teaching and learning method that facilitates multidimensional analysis by simultaneously judging the characteristics of complex learning data. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed recognition technique, we compared actual urination and device-sensed urination. An experiment was performed to evaluate the perfor-mance of the recognition technology proposed in this study. The effica-cy of smart band monitoring urination was evaluated in 10 female pa-tients without urination problems. The entire experiment was performed over a total of 3 days. The average age of the participants was 28.73 years (26–34 years), and there were no signs of dysuria. The final accuracy of the algorithm was calculated based on clinical guidelines for urologists. The experiment showed a high average accuracy of 91.0%, proving the robustness of the proposed algorithm. This urination behavior recogni-tion technique shows high accuracy and can be applied in clinical set-tings to characterize urination patterns in female patients. As wearable devices develop and become more common, algorithms that detect specific sequential body movement patterns that reflect specific physi-ological behaviors could become a new methodology to study human physiological behavior. © 2021 Korean Society of Exercise Rehabilitation","Female urinary patient; Mobile voiding chart; Support vector machine; Urination management system; Urination recognition","","","","","","Chungnam National University Hospital, CNUH","This work was supported by research fund of Chungnam National University Hospital.","P., The standardisation of terminology of lower urinary tract function: Report from the standardisation sub-committee of the international continence society, Neurourology and Urodynamics, 21, 2, pp. 167-178, (2002); P., Electronic bladder diaries of differing duration versus a paper diary for data collection in overactive bladder, Neurourology and Urodynamics, 35, 6, pp. 743-749, (2016); S.-J., Development of personalized urination recognition technology using smart bands, International Neurourology Journal, 21, pp. 76-83, (2017); C., Model-based clustering, discriminant analysis, and density estimation, Journal of the American Statistical Association, 97, 458, pp. 611-631, (2002); G.J., AN ASSESSMENT OF URODYNAMIC EXAMINATION IN INCONTINENT WOMEN, BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, 87, 10, pp. 893-896, (1980); C., Data-driven machine-learning quantifies differences in the voiding initiation network in neurogenic voiding dysfunction in women with multiple sclerosis, International Neurourology Journal, 23, 3, pp. 195-204, (2019); S.H., Voiding diary might serve as a useful tool to understand differences between bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis and overactive bladder, International Journal of Urology, 21, 2, pp. 179-183, (2014); Klevmark, Bjoørn, Natural pressure-volume curves and conventional cystometry, Scandinavian Journal of Urology and Nephrology, Supplement, 33, 201, pp. 1-4, (1999); McGuire, Edward J., Videourodynamic studies, Urologic Clinics of North America, 23, 2, pp. 309-321, (1996); J., Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for chronic prostatitis/ chronic pelvic pain syndrome: A prospective pilot study, International Neurourology Journal, 24, 2, pp. 144-149, (2020)","K.H.

We used a longitudinal case study design with ~38 h of data to explore the efficacy of electrodermal activity, skin temperature, and heart rate for classifying mental effort. We utilized a 2-state Markov switching regression model to understand the efficacy of these physiological measures for predicting self-reported mental effort during logged activities. On average, a model with state-dependent relationships predicted within one unit of reported mental effort (training RMSE = 0.4, testing RMSE = 0.7).

This digitisation inevitably involves rendering many dimensions of students’ bodies, activities and practices into digital data formats across learning areas: including health and physical education (HPE). These data can be used by schools and third parties to conduct surveillance of students’ bodies and learning. This article draws on findings from a project involving interviews with HPE teachers in a diverse array of schools located in eastern Australia about the ways they were using digital technologies for pedagogical purposes. The interviews included questions concerning to what extent the teachers were aware of personal data security and privacy issues related to their students. While the use of datafication technologies such as apps and wearable devices for HPE teaching was common among our participants, for the most part, these teachers were not considering issues such as who could gain access to students’ personal information and how these data might be breached or exploited by third parties. These findings are discussed within the broader contexts of young people’s personal data privacy rights and schools’ role in protecting students’ information. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","","","","","","","Australian Research Council, ARC, (DP1501011904)","This project was funded by the Australian Research Council and Discovery Project grant (DP1501011904).

In order to improve the efficiency of athletes' gait recognition, this paper studies the different recognition technologies of athletes based on machine learning and spectral feature technology and applies computer vision technology to sports. Moreover, according to the calf angular velocity signal, the occurrence of leg movement is detected in real time, and the gait cycle is accurately divided to reduce the influence of the signal unrelated to the behavior on the recognition process. In addition, this study proposes a gait behavior recognition method based on event-driven strategies. This method uses a gyroscope as the main sensor and uses a wearable sensor node to collect the angular velocity signals of the legs and waist. In addition, this study analyzes the performance of the algorithm proposed by this paper through experimental research. The comparison results show that the method proposed by this paper has improved the number of recognition action types and accuracy and has certain advantages from the perspective of computation and scalability. © 2021 - IOS Press.

Limitations in the employed approaches include lack of capacity to mark events in the data, and to explain other variables relating to performance outcomes. This paper aims to address these limitations, and to support the utility of wearable EDA sensor technology in educational research settings. These aims are achieved through use of a bespoke time mapping software which identifies key events during task performance and by taking a novel approach to synthesizing EDA data from a qualitative behavioral perspective. A convergent mixed method design is presented whereby the associated implementation follows a two-phase approach. The first phase involves the collection of the required EDA and behavioral data. Phase two outlines a mixed method analysis with two approaches of synthesizing the EDA data with behavioral analyses. There is an optional third phase, which would involve the sequential collection of any additional data to support contextualizing or interpreting the EDA and behavioral data. The inclusion of this phase would turn the method into a complex sequential mixed method design. Through application of the convergent or complex sequential mixed method, valuable insight can be gained into the complexities of individual learning experiences and support clearer inferences being made on the factors relating to performance. These inferences can be used to inform task design and contribute to the improvement of the teaching and learning experience. © 2020 by the authors.

The collected data is processed and analyzed on fog and cloud through various algorithms to obtain an efficient solution to diverse problems. IoT has a wide range of spectrum for its implementation, and several industries have already started deploying a smart and efficient ecosystem. The Education sector is among these industries. There are many implementations of IoT for Smart Learning such as the use of smart boards in the classrooms, mobile applications allowing impromptu access to learning resources anywhere. These advancements are only the tip of the iceberg. The network of smart things can be utilized to make the learning process even smarter and more efficient. Even though the classes are equipped with smart devices, it is hard for educators to attend each student individually and find out the areas where they are facing problems, as every individual has a different learning pattern. Keeping track of the students and to assist them individually requires a lot of time and effort. The level of difficulty increases further when face-to-face learning is switched to online learning.

It integrates students' learning activity data from the learning management system (LMS) and physical activities data from the mobile health applications or wearable devices. These activity data provide a data-rich context for students to train their self-direction skills, such as planning, monitoring and reflection. The reflection skill plays an important role in the self-directed cycle, and therefore students should be given more opportunities to practically execute the skill and further improve it. This paper proposes a self-reflection model to support the acquisition of reflection skills in students' self-directed learning and physical activities. The model is built on reflective process and strategies in self-direction and self-regulation. It allows students to reflect on their plans and achievements in the planning-monitoring-reflection process and enables them to consider their reflective strategies. The conceptual contribution of this paper is applying reflection theory to the practice in self-directed activities through computer based scaffolds. © ICCE 2020 - 28th International Conference on Computers in Education, Proceedings.

However, currently, it is difficult to distinguish diverse types of ghost images automatically; thus, lookup-tables (LUTs) for multi-grayscale waveform design cannot be effectively generated but require cumbersome manual adjustment. In this article, we proposed to adopt a convolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically recognize ghost images, based on which, LUTs that could suppress ghost images and achieve accurate grayscales were automatically generated for waveform design. Moreover, the workforce for manual adjustment was significantly saved. The results suggest that the CNN is a powerful tool for EPDs to achieve better image quality, as well as less manual cost. © 1975-2011 IEEE.","driving waveform; electronic paper (e-paper); Electrophoretic display (EPD); machine learning","Automation; Convolution; Electrophoretic displays; Image recognition; Intelligent buildings; Table lookup; Waveform analysis; Application prospect; Automatically generated; Gray-scale switching; History dependence; Lookup tables (LUTs); Low-power consumption; Waveform designs; Wearable devices; Convolutional neural networks","","","","","Sun Yat-sen University, SYSU, (19lgzd12); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities of the Central South University; Special Project for Research and Development in Key areas of Guangdong Province, (2019B01093400)","Funding text 1: This work was supported in part by the Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province under Grant 2019B01093400, and by Fundamental Research Funds for the Central University, Sun Yat-sen University under Grant 19lgzd12.; Funding text 2: Manuscript received April 16, 2020; revised July 28, 2020, September 7, 2020, October 8, 2020, and October 14, 2020; accepted October 15, 2020.

One challenge for wearable systems is their ability to discriminate head impacts from recorded spurious signals. This study describes the development and evaluation of a head impact detection system consisting of a mouthguard sensor and machine learning model for distinguishing head impacts from spurious events in football games. Twenty-one collegiate football athletes participating in 11 games during the 2018 and 2019 seasons wore a custom-fit mouthguard instrumented with linear and angular accelerometers to collect kinematic data. Video was reviewed to classify sensor events, collected from instrumented players that sustained head impacts, as head impacts or spurious events. Data from 2018 games were used to train the ML model to classify head impacts using kinematic data features (127 head impacts; 305 non-head impacts). Performance of the mouthguard sensor and ML model were evaluated using an independent test dataset of 3 games from 2019 (58 head impacts; 74 non-head impacts). Based on the test dataset results, the mouthguard sensor alone detected 81.6% of video-confirmed head impacts while the ML classifier provided 98.3% precision and 100% recall, resulting in an overall head impact detection system that achieved 98.3% precision and 81.6% recall. © 2020, Biomedical Engineering Society.","American football; Concussion; Feature engineering; Head kinematics; Instrumented mouthguard; Machine learning; On-field impacts","Classification (of information); Football; Kinematics; Statistical tests; Angular accelerometer; Field performance; Football game; Kinematic data; Machine learning models; Rule changes; Spurious signals; Wearable systems; Wearable sensors; area under the curve; Article; athlete; bioengineering; biomechanics; controlled study; descriptive research; football; head impact; human; human experiment; instrumented mouthguard; kinematics; machine learning; measurement precision; priority journal; process optimization; scoring system; time series analysis; video game; accelerometry; adolescent; adult; clinical trial; electronic device; head; head injury; injury; male; mouth protector; pathology; pathophysiology; videorecording; Accelerometry; Adolescent; Adult; Craniocerebral Trauma; Head; Humans; Male; Mouth Protectors; Video Recording; Wearable Electronic Devices","","","ADXL373, Analog Devices; ADXLA360, Analog Devices; TRIOS","Analog Devices; Analog Devices","Ferring Research Institute, FRI","The research presented in this paper was made possible by a grant from Football Research, Inc.

Existing approaches to measuring student engagement typically rely on survey-based instruments. While effective, those approaches are time-consuming and labour-intensive. Meanwhile, both the response rate and quality of the survey are usually poor. As an alternative, in this paper, we investigate whether we can infer and predict engagement at multiple dimensions, just using sensors. We hypothesize that multidimensional student engagement level can be translated into physiological responses and activity changes during the class, and also be affected by the environmental changes. Therefore, we aim to explore the following questions: Can we measure the multiple dimensions of high school student's learning engagement including emotional, behavioural and cognitive engagement with sensing data in the wild? Can we derive the activity, physiological, and environmental factors contributing to the different dimensions of student learning engagement? If yes, which sensors are the most useful in differentiating each dimension of the engagement? Then, we conduct an in-situ study in a high school from 23 students and 6 teachers in 144 classes over 11 courses for 4 weeks. We present the n-Gage, a student engagement sensing system using a combination of sensors from wearables and environments to automatically detect student in-class multidimensional learning engagement. Extensive experiment results show that n-Gage can accurately predict multidimensional student engagement in real-world scenarios with an average mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.788 and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.975 using all the sensors. We also show a set of interesting findings of how different factors (e.g., combinations of sensors, school subjects, CO2 level) affect each dimension of the student learning engagement. © 2020 ACM.","Electrodermal Activity; Engagement Prediction; Students; Wearable","Forecasting; Gages; Mean square error; Physiological models; Physiology; Students; Surveys; Academic performance; Environmental change; Environmental factors; High school students; Mean absolute error; Physiological response; Real-world scenario; Root mean square errors; Wearable sensors","","","","","","","Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive Mobile Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies, (2019); N.D., GSR and HRV: Its application in clinical diagnosis, Proceedings of the IEEE Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems, pp. 279-283, (2003); J.L., Psychophysiology: Human behavior and physiological response, pp. 1-659, (2010); B.M., Heart rate variability as an index of regulated emotional responding, Review of General Psychology, 10, 3, pp. 229-240, (2006); J.J., Measuring cognitive and psychological engagement: Validation of the Student Engagement Instrument, Journal of School Psychology, 44, 5, pp. 427-445, (2006); K.E., Student empowerment, awareness, and self-regulation through a quantified-self student tool, ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, pp. 526-527, (2017); Bakker, Jorn, What's your current stress level?

This concept is beginning to be applied to tracking of cognitive load. It is well known that activity in the brain can be measured through changes in the body’s physiology, but current real-time measures tend to be unimodal and invasive. We therefore propose the concept of a wearable educational fitness (EduFit) tracker. We use machine learning with physiological data to understand how to develop a wearable device that tracks cognitive load accurately in real time. In an initial study, we found that body temperature, skin conductance, and heart rate were able to distinguish between (i) a problem solving activity (high cognitive load), (ii) a leisure activity (moderate cognitive load), and (iii) daydreaming (low cognitive load) with high accuracy in the test dataset. In a second study, we found that these physiological features can be used to predict accurately user-reported mental focus in the test dataset, even when relatively small numbers of training data were used. We explain how these findings inform the development and implementation of a wearable device for temporal tracking and logging a user’s learning activities and cognitive load. © 2020 by the authors.

This paper considers a sophisticated real-time learning analytics platform for analyzing students' learning states and learning activities with wearable devices and deep learning. During the experimental period of this platform, students will receive instant notifications from an intelligent mobile application when their heart rate are out of their normal range so that the actual learning activities conducted by students can be collected to train deep learning models for recognizing their learning activities. At the same time, students can enjoy the sleeping monitoring and the exercise monitoring functionalities provided by the smart watches in this platform. The results of the interviews conducted after the experiment for this platform demonstrate that 89% of students think that this platform is useful for their daily lives and 65% of students report that this platform brings positive effects on their learning in different aspects.

Spastic movements of their upper and lower limbs are periodically measured to evaluate functional outcomes of physical rehabilitation, and they are quantified by clinical outcome measures such as the modified Ashworth scale (MAS). This study proposes a method to determine the severity of elbow spasticity, by analyzing the acceleration and rotation attributes collected from the elbow of the affected side of patients and machine-learning algorithms to classify the degree of spastic movement; this approach is comparable to assigning an MAS score. We collected inertial data from participants using a wearable device incorporating inertial measurement units during a passive stretch test. Machine-learning algorithms—including decision tree, random forests (RFs), support vector machine, linear discriminant analysis, and multilayer perceptrons—were evaluated in combinations of two segmentation techniques and feature sets. A RF performed well, achieving up to 95.4% accuracy. This work not only successfully demonstrates how wearable technology and machine learning can be used to generate a clinically meaningful index but also offers rehabilitation patients an opportunity to monitor the degree of spasticity, even in nonhealthcare institutions where the help of clinical professionals is unavailable. © 2020 by the authors.

Data generated from images captured from mobile devices, unmanned aerial vehicles, wearable sensors, building information modeling (BIM), and others present an opportunity for construction safety professionals and in many other sectors to analyze and benefit from the insights generated from the data using AI, machine learning and deep learning systems. For example, AI-based algorithms can be used to scan images from jobsites for safety hazards, such as workers not wearing protective equipment, and correlate the images with accident records; identify unsafe worker behavior and suggest training and education priorities; or track the real-time interactions of workers, machinery, and objects on the site and alert supervisors of potential safety issues. Using AI to execute the existing Shock and Arc Flash Risk Assessment Procedure templates from CSA Z462 and NFPA 70E as real-world scenarios and the potential ethical factors from the workers perspectives will also be discussed.

In addition to cognitive and physical data about learners, recent research is motivated by the correlation between data on the physiological dimension and the cognitive performance. In order to collect physiological data, different types of physiological sensors can be used, among which the popularization of brain-computer interfaces using wearable EEG sensors has sparked the interest of research in the field of education. The affective, attentional or motivational state of an individual can be determined using physiological parameters. The research question to be investigated is: How accurate are the algorithms (e.g., classifying attentional states) implemented in wearable EEG devices in a learning setting? This paper proposes a concurrent validity approach to verify the accuracy of the algorithms integrated in EEG devices, i.e., comparing the classifying output against the response of EEG band power. For this purpose, a wearable EEG device of NeuroSky has been deployed and attention was taken as a physiological metric of interest. In order to investigate the accuracy of NeuroSky’s attention algorithms in the context of learning, an experiment was conducted with 23 subjects, with mean age 24.17 ± 3.68, who utilized a pedagogical agent to learn Java syntax while having their attention measured by the NeuroSky’s EEG device. The results of the experiment support the claim that the device does in fact represent a user’s attention accurately in a learning setting. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Attention; Brain-computer interface; Concurrent validity; EEG; NeuroSky; Physiological computing","Artificial intelligence; Brain computer interface; Physiological models; Psychophysiology; Wearable sensors; Cognitive performance; Feature classification; Pedagogical agents; Physiological data; Physiological parameters; Physiological sensors; Recent researches; Research questions; Learning algorithms","","","","","","","Human Anterior and Frontal Midline Theta and Lower Alpha Reflect Emotionally Positive State and Internalized Attention High Resolution EEG Investigation of Meditation, (2001); Quantified EEG Spectral Analysis of Sleep and Transcendental Meditation, (1974); A Review of Alpha Activity in Integrative Brain Function Fundamental Physiology Sensory Coding Cognition and Pathology, (2012); Using Video to Automatically Detect Learner Affect in Computer Enabled Classrooms, (2016); N., The Affective Experience of Novice Computer Programmers, International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, 27, 1, pp. 181-206, (2017); Evaluating A Brain Computer Interface to Categorise Human Emotional Response, (2025); Handbook of Learning Analytics, (2017); Fundamentals of Physiological Computing, (2009); Top 14 EEG Hardware Companies Ranked; Sensor Based Adaptive Learning Lessons Learned, (2019)","N.-T.

With wearable sensor technology, various physiological and contextual data can be detected and collected. To provide learners with a context-aware personal learning support, we have researched physiological sensor data (EDA and ECG) by providing emotional stimulants to 70 students from two higher education institutes. We have analyzed our collected data using multiple methods (qualitative, quantitative, machine learning and fuzzy logic approaches) and found a relation between physiological sensor data and emotion that seems promising.

With a principal focus on mobile-assisted language learning (MALL), it draws on insights derived from MALL language, literacy and cultural projects to illustrate the possibilities inherent in all mobile learning. In its broad sweep the book takes in new and emerging technologies and tools from robots to holograms, virtual reality to augmented reality, and smart glasses to embeddable chips, considering their potential impact on education and, indeed, on human society and the planet as a whole. While not shying away from discussing the risks, it demonstrates that, handled appropriately, mobile, context-aware technologies allow educators to build on the personalised and collaborative learning facilitated by web 2.0 and social media, but simultaneously to go much further in promoting authentic learning experiences grounded in real-world encounters. In this way, teachers can better prepare students to face a global, mobile future, with all of its evolving possibilities and challenges. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.","Digital literacy/literacies; Educational learning trails; Educational treasure hunts; Mobile augmented reality learning; Mobile big data; Mobile gamification; Mobile learning analytics; Mobile literacy/literacies; Mobile personal learning environments; Mobile personal learning networks; Mobile professional development for teachers; Mobile virtual reality learning; Mobile-assisted language learning; Networking literacy; Overview of m-learning; Overview of mobile learning; Wearable devices in education","","","","","","","","C., Key themes in mobile learning: Prospects for learner-generated learning through AR and VR, Australasian Journal of Educational Technology, 33, 6, pp. 27-40, (2017); K., Neoliberalism, language, and migration, pp. 79-101, (2017); Machine Learning the New AI, (2016); M., Inclusive sensory ethnography: Studying new media and neurodiversity in everyday life, New Media and Society, 20, 10, pp. 3560-3579, (2018); What to Think about Machines that Think Todays Leading Thinkers on the Age of Machine Intelligence, (2015); Future of Truth and Misinformation Online, (2017); Digital Punctuation Practices Reflexivity and Enregisterment in the Case of, (2017); J.E., Robot-proof: Higher education in the age of artificial intelligence, pp. 1-187, (2017); Overcomplicated Technology at the Limits of Comprehension, (2016); Great Convergence Information Technology and the New Globalization, (2016)","","","Springer Singapore","","","","","","","9789811512407; 9789811512391","","","English","Mob.

While human activity recognition from smartphone data or other types of inertial measurement units (IMU) has evolved to one of the most prominent daily life examples of machine learning, the underlying process of time-series feature engineering still seems to be time-consuming. This lengthy process inhibits the development of IMU-based machine learning applications in sport science and precision medicine. This contribution discusses a feature engineering workflow, which automates the extraction of time-series feature on based on the FRESH algorithm (FeatuRe Extraction based on Scalable Hypothesis tests) to identify statistically significant features from synchronized IMU sensors (IMeasureU Ltd., NZ). The feature engineering workflow has five main steps: time-series engineering, automated time-series feature extraction, optimized feature extraction, fitting of a specialized classifier, and deployment of optimized machine learning pipeline. The workflow is discussed for the case of a user-specific running-walking classification, and the generalization to a multi-user multi-activity classification is demonstrated. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","","Extraction; Feature extraction; Machine learning; mHealth; Sports; Time series; Wearable sensors; Activity classifications; Activity recognition; Feature engineerings; Human activity recognition; Inertial measurement unit; Inertial measurements; Machine learning applications; Time series features; Engineering education","","","","","","","A., Toward automatic activity classification and movement assessment during a sports training session, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 2, 1, pp. 23-32, (2015); M., Time Series FeatuRe Extraction on basis of Scalable Hypothesis tests (tsfresh – A Python package), Neurocomputing, 307, pp. 72-77, (2018); Feature Engineering for Machine Learning and Data Analytics, (2018); B.D., hctsa: A Computational Framework for Automated Time-Series Phenotyping Using Massive Feature Extraction, Cell Systems, 5, 5, pp. 527-531.e3, (2017); Ó.D., A survey on human activity recognition using wearable sensors, IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials, 15, 3, pp. 1192-1209, (2013); F., Scikit-learn: Machine learning in Python, Journal of Machine Learning Research, 12, pp. 2825-2830, (2011); Imeasureu Bluethunder Sensor Sensor Specification 1 5 Vicon Imeasureu Limited, (2018)","A.W.

Such learning records provide new opportunities to model students' learning process. On the other hand, it has become more common to see students having wearable devices that assist in tracking their personal physical activities. These activity tracking can be integrated into a data-rich context for training students for developing their data-informed self-direction skills. We are building the GOAL (Goal Oriented Active Learner) system to support the development of self-direction skills using learning and health activity data. A key phase in any self-directed activity is goal setting and planning. This paper will introduce how to build a new model for self-planning and support the acquisition of planning skills in the GOAL system. We combine learners’ data from the self-directed activity and their interaction trace to build the model in the GOAL system. The modeling involves computing of trend value and degree of plan difficulty, then diagnosis of planning skills using a 5-point scoring criteria. An adaptive support is selected based on the computed score. The contribution of this work is modeling planning and promoting planning skills in a data-driven manner.

Developing such fusion system has three problems: 1) how to pre-process signals with different temporal characteristics and noise models, 2) how to train the fusion system with limited labeled data and 3) how to fuse multiple signals with inaccurate and inexact ground truth. To overcome these challenges, I plan to explore semi-supervised, weakly supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods to obtain precise emotion recognition in mobile environments. By developing such techniques, we can measure the user engagement with larger amounts of participants and apply the emotion recognition techniques in a variety of scenarios such as mobile video watching and online education. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Emotion recognition; Machine learning; Mobile Environments; Physiological sensors","Biomedical signal processing; Distance education; Interactive computer systems; Learning systems; Machine learning; Physiology; Speech recognition; Emotion recognition; Mobile environments; Multi-modal fusion; On-line education; Physiological sensors; Semi-supervised; Temporal characteristics; Unsupervised machine learning; Wearable sensors","","","","","","","International Conference on Machine Learning, (2013); Multidimesnional Measures of Affects Emotions and Mood States, (2015); Structure of Emotion, (1993); M.M., The pupil as a measure of emotional arousal and autonomic activation, Psychophysiology, 45, 4, pp. 602-607, (2008); C.E., Identifying Mislabeled Training Data, Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 11, pp. 131-167, (1999); R.A., Affect detection: An interdisciplinary review of models, methods, and their applications, IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing, 1, 1, pp. 18-37, (2010); W.B., Again the James-Lange and the thalamic theories of emotion, Psychological Review, 38, 4, pp. 281-295, (1931); Adv Mater, (2025); Neurocomputing, (2019); R., Real-time inference of complex mental states from facial expressions and head gestures, pp. 181-200, (2005)","T.

To be specific, we investigated many research issues such as the parameters of adaptive/personalized learning, learning supports, learning outcomes, subjects, participants, hardware, and so on. Furthermore, this study reveals that personalized/adaptive learning has always been an attractive topic in this field, and personalized data sources, for example, students’ preferences, learning achievements, profiles, and learning logs have become the main parameters for supporting personalized/adaptive learning. In addition, we found that the majority of the studies on personalized/adaptive learning still only supported traditional computers or devices, while only a few studies have been conducted on wearable devices, smartphones and tablet computers. In other words, personalized/adaptive learning has a significant number of potential applications on the above smart devices with the rapid development of artificial intelligence, virtual reality, cloud computing and wearable computing.

Yet, public speaking anxiety (PSA) ranks as a top social phobia among many people. This paper leverages bio-behavioural indices captured from wearable devices and virtual reality (VR) interfaces to quantify PSA. The significance of individual-specific factors, such as general trait anxiety and personality, as well as contextual factors, such as age, gender, highest education, and native language, in moderating the association between bio-behavioral indices and PSA is further examined through group-based machine learning models. Results highlight the importance of including such factors for detecting PSA with the proposed group-based PSA models yielding Spearman's correlation of 0.55(p < 0.05) between the actual and predicted state-based anxiety scores. This work further analyzes whether systematic exposure to public speaking tasks in the VR environment can help alleviate PSA. Results indicate that systematic exposure to public speaking in VR can alleviate PSA in terms of both self-reported (p < 0.05) and physiological (p < 0.05) indices. Findings of this study will enable researchers to better understand antedecedents and causes of PSA contributing to behavioral interventions using VR. © 2019 IEEE.","Group-based clustering; Physiological signals; Public speaking anxiety; Speech; Virtual reality; Wearable devices","Physiology; Speech; Virtual reality; Wearable technology; Behavioral interventions; Contextual factors; Group-based; Machine learning models; Physiological signals; Public speaking; Virtual reality interfaces; Wearable devices; Intelligent computing","","","","","Engineering Information Foundation, EiF","The authors would like to acknowledge the Engineering Information Foundation (EiF) for funding this work.","N.E., Contributions of self-efficacy theory to career counseling: A personal perspective, Career Development Quarterly, 52, 4, pp. 340-353, (2004); F.R., Social anxiety disorder, New England Journal of Medicine, 355, 10, pp. 1029-1036, (2006); Royal College of Psychiatrists, (2013); Boonkit, Kamonpan, Enhancing the development of speaking skills for non-native speakers of English, Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences, 2, 2, pp. 1305-1309, (2010); G.D., A racing heart, rattling knees, and ruminative thoughts: Defining, explaining, and treating public speaking anxiety, Communication Education, 59, 1, pp. 70-105, (2010); M., Empatica E3 - A wearable wireless multi-sensor device for real-time computerized biofeedback and data acquisition, pp. 39-42, (2015); M.J., Effects of Public Speaking Trait Anxiety and Intensity of Speaking Task on Heart Rate During Performance, Human Communication Research, 18, 2, pp. 147-176, (1991); L., Cicero - Towards a multimodal virtual audience platform for public speaking training, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 8108 LNAI, pp. 116-128, (2013); L., Towards automated assessment of public speaking skills using multimodal cues, pp. 200-203, (2014); U., Autonomic reactions to social and neutral stimuli in subjects high and low in public speaking fear, Biological Psychology, 23, 3, pp. 223-233, (1986)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","8th International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction, ACII 2019","2019-09-03 through 2019-09-06","Cambridge","155962","","9781728138886","","","English","Int.

Therefore, we develop an intelligent interactive education system, which leverages wearable devices (smart watches) to accurately capture hand gestures of school students and respond instantly to teachers so as to increase the interaction and attraction of school students in class. In addition, through multiple physical information of school students from the smart watch, it can find out the crux points of the learning process according to the deep data analysis. In this way, it can provide teachers to make instant adjustments and suggest school students to achieve multi-learning and innovative thinking. The system is mainly composed of three components: (1) smart interactive watch; (2) teacher-side smart application (App); and (3) cloud-based analysis system. Specifically, the smart interactive watch is responsible for detecting the physical information and interaction results of school students, and then giving feedback to the teachers. The teacher-side app will provide real-time learning suggestions to adjust the teaching pace to avoid learning disability. The cloud-based analysis system provides intelligent learning advices, academic performance prediction and anomaly learning detection. Through field trials, our system has been verified that can potentially enhance teaching and learning processes for both educators and school students. © 2019 by the authors.

We investigate how youth with no programming experience can incorporate ML classifiers into athletic practice by building models of their own physical activity. In this paper, we describe a design experiment exploring how to introduce youth to making ML models within the context of their athletic interests. We present AlpacaML, an iOS application that connects to wearable sensors and allows young people to model physical movement using an ML classifier and detail its use in a threehour workshop with middle-and high-school athletes. We found the youth were able to collect data, build models, test and evaluate models, and quickly iterate on this process.

Over the past few decades, technological advancements have revolutionized the way humans deliver presentation. Conventionally, the quality of a presentation is usually evaluated through painstaking manual analysis with experts. Although the expert feedback is effective in assisting users to improve their presentation skills, manual evaluation suffers from high cost and is often not available to most individuals. In this work, we propose a novel multi-sensor self-quantification system for presentations, which is designed based on a new proposed assessment rubric. We present our analytics model with conventional ambient sensors (i.e., static cameras and Kinect sensor) and the emerging wearable egocentric sensors (i.e., Google Glass). In addition, we performed a cross-correlation analysis of speaker's vocal behavior and body language. The proposed framework is evaluated on a new presentation dataset, namely, NUS Multi-Sensor Presentation dataset, which consists of 51 presentations covering a diverse range of topics. To validate the efficacy of the proposed system, we have conducted a series of user studies with the speakers and an interview with an English communication expert, which reveals positive and promising feedback. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Learning analytics; Multi-modal analysis; Presentations; Quantified self","Modal analysis; Quality control; Wearable sensors; Assessment rubrics; Cross-correlation analysis; Learning analytics; Manual analysis; Presentation skills; Presentations; Quantified self; Technological advancement; Feedback","","","","","Fundamental Research Fund of Shandong University, (2017HW001); Fundamental Research Fund of Shandong University; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This research is supported by the National Research Foundation, Prime Minister’s Office, Singapore under its Strategic Capability Research Centres Funding Initiative; National Natural Science Foundation of China, No.:61702302; and Fundamental Research Funds of Shandong University (No. 2017HW001).

Mobile teaching has its own advantages and disadvantages and is adopted as a complementary teaching method to traditional teaching in many schools and universities. Mobile app provides a good solution as an assisting teaching tool to increase learning efficiency, engage students in learning, and enhance learning performances. The Chinese character-writing program is a mobile application designed and implemented in ACF Wollongong School, which targets on writing practices and group works. It is designed as an assisting teaching and learning tool for in-class and after-class writing practices in Chinese learning. The project is designed for primary Chinese learners. To make it available to all teachers and parents, the program is implemented by HTML5 and can be easily accessed via web browser through almost any mobile phone or computer without download or installation. Basic functions, such as showing animation of the orders of strokes, marking handwritings, cleaning writing area, and changing characters based on unit lists, are designed to meet the requirement from the Chinese language class teaching. The application was adopted in Chinese class and promoted to the parents with printed notes. The results show that the application had positive influence on students’ learning efficiency, interests in Chinese learning, and engagement in-group works with other students, teachers, and parents in competition. The future design of the application is targeting on handwriting fonts selection and social communication online. Wearable devices could be a good extended area for writing practices too. The future of language learning will be open to all new technologies and devices. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.","HTML5; Mobile learning; Mobile social media; Mobile technology; Social media; WeChat","","","","","","","","Journal of Education and Learning, (2016); F., The impact of mobile learning on ESP learners’ performance, Journal of Educators Online, 13, 2, pp. 73-101, (2016); S.U., Using Wimba Voice Board to facilitate foreign language conversation courses, pp. 63-72, (2013); Eurocall Review, (2016); Dolinský, Ján, Synthesizing handwritten characters using naturalness learning, pp. 101-106, (2007); K., Putting Education in “Educational” Apps: Lessons From the Science of Learning, Psychological Science in the Public Interest, 16, 1, pp. 3-34, (2015); C.-K., A personalized recommendation-based mobile learning approach to improving the reading performance of EFL students, Computers and Education, 63, pp. 327-336, (2013); Students More Likely to Succeed if Teachers have Positive Perceptions of Parents, (2017); Measuring the Information Society Report, (2016); Journal of Learning for Development, (2016)","Y.A.

In particular, the focus is on how spy glasses can be used as a tool for collecting data from educational situations. The chapter reports on two different cases investigated by the authors in which spy glasses were used, including considerations made from a methodological point of view. From the first case a conclusion drawn is that spy-glass recording made it possible to closely follow teaching and learning during science lab work and identify specific elements not found in video data from ordinary video cameras. The second case reports on valuable information about how the motivation to learn works in young children. Drawing further on these studies, the chapter elaborates on themes that arise as central to video research: ethics, technology and methodology, as well as selection and analysis. The chapter discusses a transformation in how childhood is considered in relation to new technology. Here children are seen as being more active and participatory in the shaping of their own childhoods. This can also result in developing new research methods in order to understand and visualise the child’s perspective, and using wearable technologies could certainly be one of these areas. In other words, it is a unique perspective when participants are co-creators of research studies. This suggests that important work awaits future research, developing and applying wearable technologies for education and educational research. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.","Excursion; Lab work; Mobile learning; Participant’s perspective; Point-of-view video glasses; Spy glasses; Wearable devices; Wearable technologies","","","","","","","","P., Producing children's corporeal privacy: Ethnographic video recording as material-discursive practice, Qualitative Research, 10, 2, pp. 249-268, (2010); L., The Internet of Things: A survey, Computer Networks, 54, 15, pp. 2787-2805, (2010); Society for Information Technology and Teacher Education International Conference 2017, (2017); Fundamentals of Wearable Computers and Augmented Reality, (2001); M., What are the educational affordances of wearable technologies?, Computers and Education, 88, pp. 343-353, (2015); P., Introduction: Researching children and childhood cultures of communication, pp. 1-9, (2008); Sociology of Childhood, (1997); S.J., Conducting video research in the learning sciences: Guidance on selection, analysis, technology, and ethics, Journal of the Learning Sciences, 19, 1, pp. 3-53, (2010); N., Teacher–student interaction in contemporary science classrooms: is participation still a question of gender?†, International Journal of Science Education, 38, 10, pp. 1655-1672, (2016); Researching Children S Experience, (2005)","J.

The VR wearable devices manufacturing has been significantly grown those days, the performance and quality have reached an incredible level of improvement. Developing technologies for human use such as VR wearable devices, must taking in the account not only the technical specifications, but also the Human Factors (HF) which involves people and technology must be considered to improve the level of user's acceptance. There are many approaches to define HF for any product based on user impression about that product such as questionnaires, surveys or interviews, but these methods could be extremely peripheral and poor methods because of unfair questions and answers, respondents truthful and the difficulties on finding users actual emotion. Thus, emotion could be considered as an affective component in the user opinion about a product and then in the human factors. This paper proposed an adaptive multi-label classification model (HF-EMA) based on supervised learning method, to predict five human factors from users' tweets (wearability, usability, safety, satisfaction and aesthetics) and to analyze and classify users' emotion regarding those factors into four emotions (Happy, Sad, Anger and Love). The experimental results proved the validity of the proposed model in predicting and classification process, it was given competitive results in predicting human factors from users tweets and then measure the users' emotion regarding those factors, with an average of ROC = 1, naïve base classifiers outperform the other classifiers. The results indicated that, the usability factor is the most affected factor on VR wearables following by wearability. © 2019 The Authors.

Traditionally, the management of DR has been on tertiary-level treatment (eg, laser, anti-VEGF injections and surgery) in specialized settings by highly trained ophthalmologists on individual patients. To win the war on DR, a paradigm shift in strategic focus and resources must be made from such tertiary treatment toward primary and secondary prevention, which are broader, more impactful, and cost-effective for the larger population. These include improving education and awareness of risk of DR among people initially diagnosed with diabetes, promoting behavioral modifications such as physical activity and medication adherence for improving glycemic and blood pressure control, setting up systematic screening programs for DR to detect the onset or progression of the disease, and implementing cost-effective, evidence-based policies and guidelines for managing DR. Additionally, there is a need to leverage on novel technology including the application of digital big data to predict people at risk of diabetes and DR, the use of wearable devices and smart phone apps, behavioral techniques including social media for self-management of diabetes, and telemedicine-based DR screening incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) to broaden access to screening in all settings. To turn the tide on the war on DR, we must reframe DR not only as a specific condition that can be managed by ophthalmologists, but fundamentally, as a preventable condition by shifting the weight of strategies from tertiary to secondary and primary battlegrounds. © 2019 Asia-Pacific Academy of Ophthalmology.","Diabetic retinopathy; DR screening; Guidelines; Primary prevention; Secondary prevention","blindness; diabetic retinopathy; evidence based medicine; human; mass screening; organization and management; patient education; primary health care; procedures; telemedicine; Blindness; Diabetic Retinopathy; Evidence-Based Medicine; Humans; Mass Screening; Patient Education as Topic; Primary Health Care; Telemedicine","","","","","","","Idf Diabetes Atlas, (2013); J.W.Y., Global prevalence and major risk factors of diabetic retinopathy, Diabetes Care, 35, 3, pp. 556-564, (2012); J.L., Global estimates on the number of people blind or visually impaired by diabetic retinopathy: A meta-analysis from 1990 to 2010, Diabetes Care, 39, 9, pp. 1643-1649, (2016); T.R., A public health approach to winning the war against cancer, Oncologist, 13, 12, pp. 1306-1313, (2008); J.C.N., Diabetes in Asia: epidemiology, risk factors, and pathophysiology, JAMA, 301, 20, pp. 2129-2140, (2009); A., Diabetes in Asia, The Lancet, 375, 9712, pp. 408-418, (2010); L.-A., Prevalence of diabetic retinopathy in type 2 diabetes in developing and developed countries, Diabetic Medicine, 30, 4, pp. 387-398, (2013); Wong, Tienyin, Rates of progression in diabetic retinopathy during different time periods: A systematic review and meta-analysis, Diabetes Care, 32, 12, pp. 2307-2313, (2009); X., Prevalence of diabetic retinopathy in the United States, 2005-2008, JAMA, 304, 6, pp. 649-656, (2010); R., Epidemiology of diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema and related vision loss, Eye and Vision, 2, 1, (2015)","T.Y.

Most previous studies using self-report questionnaires face problems with reliability and consistency due to recall bias or misclassification among older people. Therefore, objective measurement of lifestyle components is needed to confirm the relationships between lifestyle factors and cognitive function. Aims: The current study examined the relationship between lifestyle factors collected with wearable sensors and cognitive function among community-dwelling older people using machine learning. Methods: In total, 855 participants (mean age: 73.8 years) wore a wristband sensor for 7.8 days on average every 3 months. Various lifestyle parameters were measured, including walking steps, conversation time, total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency, time awake after sleep onset, awakening count, napping time, and heart rate. Random forest (RF) regression analysis was used to examine the relationships between total daily sensing data and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. Confounding factor analysis was conducted with models that were adjusted and unadjusted for demographic and vascular risk factors, and selected variables were assessed as risk and protective factors using partial dependence plots (PDPs). Results: Lifestyle data were collected for 31.3 ± 7.1 days per year using wristband sensors. RF regression analysis adjusted for age, gender, and education levels selected four variables, including number of walking steps, conversation time, TST, and heart rate. Moreover, walking steps, conversation time, and heart rate remained after RF regression analysis adjusted for demographic and vascular risk factors. Number of walking steps, conversation time, and heart rate were categorized as protective factors, whereas TST was categorized as a risk factor for cognitive function. Although PDPs of number of walking steps and heart rate revealed continuously increased MMSE scores, those of conversation time and TST and revealed that the tendency in the graph was reversed at the boundary of a particular threshold (321.1 min for conversation time, 434.1 min for TST). Conclusions: Lifestyle factors, such as physical activity, sleep, and social activity appear to be associated with cognitive function among older people. Physical activity and appropriate durations of sleep and conversation are important for cognitive function. © © 2019 Kimura, Aso, Yabuuchi, Ishibashi, Hori, Sasaki, Nakamichi, Uesugi, Fujioka, Iwao, Jikumaru, Katayama, Sumi, Eguchi, Nonaka, Kakumu and Matsubara.","Cognitive function; Cross-sectional study; Lifestyle factors; Mini-mental state examination; Random forest regression analysis; Wearable sensor","aged; arousal; Article; cardiovascular risk; cognition; community dwelling person; controlled study; conversation; cross-sectional study; female; geriatrics; heart rate; human; lifestyle; machine learning; male; Mini Mental State Examination; observational study; random forest; risk assessment; sleep time; sleep waking cycle; stage 1 sleep; walking","","","","","Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development, AMED, (18he1402003, 19K07916)","This research was supported by AMED under Grant Number 18he1402003, Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C) under Grant Number 19K07916, and Oita prefectural office.","G., Dementia prevention, intervention, and care, The Lancet, 390, 10113, pp. 2673-2734, (2017); M.L., Risk factors and preventive interventions for alzheimer disease: State of the science, Archives of Neurology, 68, 9, pp. 1185-1190, (2011); S., Potential for primary prevention of Alzheimer's disease: An analysis of population-based data, The Lancet Neurology, 13, 8, pp. 788-794, (2014); D.E., The projected effect of risk factor reduction on Alzheimer's disease prevalence, The Lancet Neurology, 10, 9, pp. 819-828, (2011); L., Potentially modifiable lifestyle factors, cognitive reserve, and cognitive function in later life: A cross-sectional study, PLOS Medicine, 14, 3, (2017); W., Meta-analysis of modifiable risk factors for Alzheimer's disease, Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry, 86, 12, pp. 1299-1306, (2015); L., An active and socially integrated lifestyle in late life might protect against dementia, The Lancet Neurology, 3, 6, pp. 343-353, (2004); J., Total daily sleep duration and the risk of dementia: A prospective population-based study, European Journal of Neurology, 16, 9, pp. 990-997, (2009); J.M., Fragmentation of the rest-activity rhythm correlates with age-related cognitive deficits, Journal of Sleep Research, 18, 1, pp. 129-135, (2009); J., Long sleep duration in elders without dementia increases risk of dementia mortality (NEDICES), Neurology, 83, 17, pp. 1530-1537, (2014)","N.

Next, by leveraging the established theory that links learner activities to learner engagement, the detected learner activities can be used to further infer the learner engagement levels, durations, and other key information. We thus designed a hassle-free and non-intrusive system running on the latest wrist-worn commodity wearable devices, which adopts the latest activity recognition and sensor data fusion techniques. We conducted the system-level evaluation, survey, and interviews involving both students and teachers. The evaluation results show that our system can accomplish the accurate learner activity recognition task, and meanwhile effectively capture the learner engagement.

It is not so simple to develop such a system in practice. One of the main objectives of this platform is to adapt students’ knowledge and communication skills with the needs of the current economy and society. Another objective why we choose to create disciplines in mobile learning or blended learning format refers to the integration of transversal competences, including the communication in learning and teaching.

The goal of tools is to improve the educational process by helping the professor form a correct mental model of each student’s performance. Besides this, the developed applications are also analyzed from human computer interaction and attempt to offer effective and highly usable tools.

They influence work performance, learning outcomes [20], decision making [30], physical health and more [27]. Emotional well-being has been reported to be one of the key components of health [36]. Positive emotions help people to cope with adversity and increase the emotional well-being [32]. On the other hand, poor emotional well-being can lead to disorders such as anxiety, depression and chronic stress. A recent study from the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that globally, more than 300 million people suffer from depression, and 260 million suffer from anxiety disorders [37]. The organization found that such disorders cost the global economy 1 trillion dollars in lost productivity each year [38]. The WHO proposes among other countermeasures, the promotion and the awareness of emotional well-being and the prevention of mental health disorders as possible solutions to this critical social situation. Given the importance and the impact of emotion in people's daily life, computer science researchers have explored the role of technology for understanding and improving emotional well-being. The idea of integrating emotions and more generally affect into technology, was presented for the first time in 1997 in a seminal work by Rosalind Picard [25]. This opened a new field of study called Affective Computing. The author envisioned that giving to ""computers"" a human-like ability to recognize and even express emotions, would allow not only a better experience in the usage of electronic devices but also enable a strong support in everyday human activity. Most of the initial efforts in the Affective Computing field were conducted as controlled studies in laboratory settings [31]. Even though these approaches have been fundamental for building knowledge in this field, they present some limitations. Findings in laboratory settings often do not reflect real situations and the models built in these cases are less robust to background noise typical of real environments. With the recent advances in mobile and wearable technologies the idea of Affective Computing has reached a new dimension. The ubiquitousness and pervasiveness of mobile devices allow researchers to continuously and unobtrusively gather people's personal data in everyday life settings. This opens plenty of new possibilities for Affective Computing, enabling the creation of systems able to continuously capture large amounts of data in real environments, infer emotional state and react accordingly to ameliorate people's life. This is moving the studies on emotional well-being from laboratory settings to the real world. Researchers have recently started to use information derived from smartphone's sensors as GPS, videocamera, accelerometer, microphone, from social networks but also from wearable devices as heart rate, blood pressure and electrodermal activity to infer users' affective states [5, 15, 34]. Notwithstanding the significant amount of literature existing in this area, several challenges are still open. In the context of my research I plan to address the following challenges: (1) Developing artifacts removal mechanisms; (2) developing systems to gather reliable ground-truth data in automated manner; (3) creating effective features to model the problem of interest; (4) and validate models developed in the laboratory setting in real world environment. The goal of the research work described in this document is to contribute to overcome these challenges. In particular, I will focus on the design, development and testing of new solutions to enhance mobile and wearable systems, able to infer particular user's emotional states and intervene accordingly with the aim of improving user's well-being. Specifically I plan to investigate the mentioned problems through three specific use cases: (1) infer students' engagement during lectures using wearable devices; (2) detect and recognize laughter episodes using physiological sensors; and (3) investigate and infer affective states of workers and the relation with their performance in the workplace . These particular use cases will enable the investigation of the above mentioned challenges at different granularities: I will measure a short emotional response as laughter, a longer affective state as engagement and combine different emotions to measure an overall affective state and its impact on productivity and well-being. I expect the results obtained in these scenarios to generalize to broader categories of use cases. As a final outcome of my PhD thesis, I expect to provide a set of tools and algorithms to simplify the implementation of emotion-aware systems and to improve their effectiveness in real settings. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Emotion-aware systems; Well-being","Behavioral research; Blood pressure; Decision making; Electron devices; Health; Human computer interaction; Laboratories; Mobile telecommunication systems; Productivity; Ubiquitous computing; Wearable computers; Development and testing; Different granularities; Electrodermal activity; Emotion-aware systems; Real world environments; Users' affective state; Well being; World Health Organization; Wearable sensors","","","","","","","A., Towards an automatic early stress recognition system for office environments based on multimodal measurements: A review, Journal of Biomedical Informatics, 59, pp. 49-75, (2016); Bakker, Jorn, What's your current stress level?

The availability of learning and movement data in classroom teaching, outdoor learning and campus environments has been enhanced, owing to the emergence of wearable technologies. Consequently, the learning analytics technology for the physical spaces is emerging at the right moment. Learning spaces are facing profound transformations under the educational development of 'human-technology' co-evolution, the learning support services in physical spaces thus need to be reshaped urgently. In recent years, researchers have focused on using sensor technology to collect learners' physiological and behavioral data, combining learning analytics to infer their emotional states, and adopting appropriate intervention mechanisms to improve the positive emotional arousal and academic success. First, this paper introduces some concepts related to the perception of academic emotions in physical spaces. Then the main methods and typical cases are pointed out. Specifically, our aim was to reveal the research status and development trend of emotion perception in physical spaces under the learning analytics fields and to provide a novel insight for the future reshaping of the physical learning spaces. © 2018 IEEE.","Emotion perception; Learning analytics; Physical learning spaces; Self-adaptive learning; Wearable devices","Engineering research; Wearable sensors; Development trends; Learning analytics; Learning support services; Physical learning spaces; Self-adaptive learning; Self-regulated learning; Sensor technologies; Wearable devices; Behavioral research","","","","","(2017CFB504, 2018CFB404, 2018CFB518); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61702207, L1724007); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61702207, L1724007), Hubei Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 2018CFB518, 2018CFB404, 2017CFB504) and Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant No. CCNU18QN009, CCNU16A05046).","A.-K., Reactivity effects in video-based classroom research: an investigation using teacher and student questionnaires as well as teacher eye-tracking, Zeitschrift fur Erziehungswissenschaft, 20, pp. 49-74, (2017); undefined, (2017); Nmc Horizon Report 2017 Higher Education Edition, (2017); Society for Learning Analytics Research Eb Ol; Proceedings of Delfi and Gmw Workshops 2017 Chemnitz, (2017); H., User-Centric Approach to the Design of a Mobile Learning Companion, Lecture Notes in Informatics (LNI), Proceedings - Series of the Gesellschaft fur Informatik (GI), pp. 401-406, (2017); Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research Advances, (2014); Y., Fusion of Facial Expressions and EEG for Multimodal Emotion Recognition, Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience, 2017, (2017); S., Emotion recognition from text based on automatically generated rules, IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops, ICDMW, 2015-January, January, pp. 383-392, (2015); Advances in Psychological Science, (2014)","","Zhang, W.; Li, M.; Wang, Y.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","7th International Conference of Educational Innovation through Technology, EITT 2018","2018-12-11 through 2018-12-14","Auckland","148340","","9781538696033","","","English","Proc. - Int.

The data has the potential to inform the teachers which part of the lecture a student isn't engaged in order to provide remedial solution. © 2017 IEEE.","Heart Rate; Predict Students' Performance; Student Engagement; Wireless Weearable Sensors","Forecasting; Students; Teaching; Wearable sensors; Active Learning; Heart rate sensors; Heart rates; Historical data; Real-time data; Student engagement; Students' engagements; Students' performance; Heart","","","","","","","C., Academic Performance Predictors, pp. 577-581, (2015); I., Dropout prediction in e-learning courses through the combination of machine learning techniques, Computers and Education, 53, 3, pp. 950-965, (2009); S., A combinational incremental ensemble of classifiers as a technique for predicting students' performance in distance education, Knowledge-Based Systems, 23, 6, pp. 529-535, (2010); M.D., Measuring student engagement in the online course: The online student engagement scale (OSE), Online Learning Journal, 19, 4, (2015); M., Disengagement detection in online learning: Validation studies and perspectives, IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies, 4, 2, pp. 114-124, (2011); C., Predicting students' final performance from participation in on-line discussion forums, Computers and Education, 68, pp. 458-472, (2013); X., Mining social media data for understanding students' learning experiences, IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies, 7, 3, pp. 246-259, (2014); G.M., The Challenges of Defining and Measuring Student Engagement in Science, Educational Psychologist, 50, 1, (2015); C., A conceptual model and set of instruments for measuring student engagement in learning, Cambridge Journal of Education, 43, 3, pp. 291-311, (2013); E.S., A New Tool for Measuring Student Behavioral Engagement in Large University Classes, Journal of College Science Teaching, 44, 6, pp. 83-91, (2015)","","Kodabagi, M.M.; Manvi, S.S.; Hulipalled, V.R.; Niranjan, S.K.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2017 International Conference On Smart Technology for Smart Nation, SmartTechCon 2017","2017-08-17 through 2017-08-19","Bengaluru","136447","","9781538605684","","","English","Proc.

More specifically, using new wearable sensor technology and video instructions as an experiment guide, the students are asked to record their electrocardiograms (ECGs) and perform both time- and spectral-domain estimation tasks on their own real-world data. In this way, the students not only gain experience with recording hardware and sources of signal contamination (baseline wanders and artifacts), but they also are highly motivated by being kept in the loop and through their part ownership of their course. © 1991-2012 IEEE.","","Biomedical signal processing; Students; Teaching; Electrical and electronic engineerings; Imperial College London; Participatory approach; Sensor technologies; Signal contamination; Signal processing course; Student engagement; Video instructions; Wearable sensors","","","","","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/P008461/1, EP/P009204/1)","I am thankful to Prof. László Sujbert, Prof. Julius Smith, and Prof. Vesa Välimäki for their helpful comments.

The dataset included mobile eye-tracking as well as audiovisual and accelerometry data from sensors worn by the teacher. We evaluated both time-independent and time-aware models, achieving median F1 scores of about 0.7–0.8 on leave-one-session-out k-fold cross-validation.

Despite active research in human activity recognition over the past years, existing approaches based on computer vision or wearable sensor technologies present several significant issues such as privacy (e.g., using video camera to monitor the elderly at home) and practicality (e.g., not possible for an older person with dementia to remember wearing devices). In this paper, we present a low-cost, unobtrusive, and robust system that supports independent living of older people. The system interprets what a person is doing by deciphering signal fluctuations using radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology and machine learning algorithms. To deal with noisy, streaming, and unstable RFID signals, we develop a compressive sensing, dictionary-based approach that can learn a set of compact and informative dictionaries of activities using an unsupervised subspace decomposition. In particular, we devise a number of approaches to explore the properties of sparse coefficients of the learned dictionaries for fully utilizing the embodied discriminative information on the activity recognition task. Our approach achieves efficient and robust activity recognition via a more compact and robust representation of activities. Extensive experiments conducted in a real-life residential environment demonstrate that our proposed system offers a good overall performance and shows the promising practical potential to underpin the applications for the independent living of the elderly. © 2017 IEEE.","Activity recognition; compressive sensing; feature selection; RFID; subspace decomposition","Compressed sensing; Computer privacy; Education; Feature extraction; Houses; Independent living systems; Learning algorithms; Mobile computing; Monitoring; Pattern recognition; Robustness (control systems); Signal reconstruction; Video cameras; Wearable technology; Activity recognition; Compressive sensing; Legged locomotion; Senior citizens; Subspace decomposition; Radio frequency identification (RFID)","","","","","","","S., From today's augmented houses to tomorrow's smart homes: New directions for home automation research, pp. 105-115, (2014); Kim, Eunju, Human activity recognition and pattern discovery, IEEE Pervasive Computing, 9, 1, pp. 48-53, (2010); C., Detection of PUE attacks in cognitive radio networks based on signal activity pattern, IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing, 13, 5, pp. 1022-1034, (2014); J., Everyday patient-care technologies for Alzheimer's disease, IEEE Pervasive Computing, 12, 4, pp. 80-83, (2013); Y., Scalable activity-travel pattern monitoring framework for large-scale city environment, IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing, 11, 4, pp. 644-662, (2012); Aggarwal, Jagdishkumar Kumar K., Human activity analysis: A review, ACM Computing Surveys, 43, 3, (2011); N., Activity recognition from accelerometer data, Proceedings of the National Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 3, pp. 1541-1546, (2005); Y., Radio tomographic imaging and tracking of stationary and moving people via kernel distance, pp. 229-240, (2013); Q., Whole-home gesture recognition using wireless signals, Proceedings of the Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking, MOBICOM, pp. 27-38, (2013); A., The visual microphone: Passive recovery of sound from video, ACM Transactions on Graphics, 33, 4, (2014)","T.

Its aim is to share and discuss the new trends in current research, with specific focus on how current research on artificial intelligence combined with data science and other disciplines can support designers and developers to improve learning in its different stages. The purpose is to give and share promising ideas on approaches that cater for the increasing amount of information available from immediate (e.g., in terms of wearable devices) to broader contexts in order to provide personalized learning assistance bridging the behavioral and the computational.

In this paper, we demonstrate the practicality of developing a simple web-based application that exploits EEG data to monitor reading effectiveness personalized for individual readers. Our tool uses a variant of k-means classification on the relative power of the five standard bands (alpha, beta, gamma, delta, theta) for each of four electrodes on the Muse wearable brainwave sensor. We demonstrate that after 30 minutes of training, our relatively simple approach is able to successfully distinguish between brain signals produced when the subject engages in reading versus when they are relaxing. The accuracy of classification varied across the 10 subjects from 55% to 85% with a mean of 71%. The standard approach to recognize relaxation is to look for strong alpha and/or theta signals and it is reasonably effective but is most associated with closed eye relaxation and it does not allow for personalization. Our k-means classification approach provides a personalized classifier which distinguishes open eye relaxation from reading and has the potential to detect a wide variety of different cognitive states. © © 2018 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

Traditionally, such information is collected manually by human observers. Wearable devices, which have received a lot of attention recently, are rarely discussed in this field. In view of this, we propose a multimodal system which integrates a head-motion module, a pen-motion module, and a visual-focus module to accurately analyze students' attention levels in class. These modules collect information via cameras, accelerometers, and gyroscopes integrated in wearable devices to recognize students' behaviors. From these behaviors, attention levels are inferred for various time periods using a rule-based approach and a data-driven approach. The former infers a student's attention states using user-defined rules, while the latter relies on hidden relationships in the data. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed system has excellent performance and high accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on attention level inference in class using wearable devices. The outcome of this research has the potential of greatly increasing teaching and learning efficiency in class. © 2017 IEEE.","Activity Recognition; Attention Sensing; Body-Area Network; Machine Learning; Wearable Computing","","","","","","","","Cognitive Psychology and Its Implications, (2000); A., Internet of Things: A Survey on Enabling Technologies, Protocols, and Applications, IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials, 17, 4, pp. 2347-2376, (2015); S., The importance of eye gaze and head pose to estimating levels of attention, pp. 186-191, (2011); H., Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF), Computer Vision and Image Understanding, 110, 3, pp. 346-359, (2008); L., Activity recognition from user-annotated acceleration data, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 3001, pp. 1-17, (2004); C., Improving human action recognition using fusion of depth camera and inertial sensors, IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems, 45, 1, pp. 51-61, (2015); Documentation Opencv; H., Classifying social actions with a single accelerometer, pp. 207-210, (2013); T., Discovery of activity patterns using topic models, pp. 10-19, (2008); International Data Corporation","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE Computer Society and its Technical Committee on Computer Communications (TCCC); Macao Polytechnic Institute; Missouri University of Science and Technology (S and T); Queen Mary University of London","18th IEEE International Symposium on A World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks, WoWMoM 2017","2017-06-12 through 2017-06-15","Macau","129101","","9781538627228","","","English","IEEE Int.

Our work is motivated by the observations that: (a) the fine-grained individual-specific learner actions are crucial to understand learners and their context information; (b) sensor data available on the latest wearable devices (e.g., wrist-worn and eye wear devices) can effectively recognize learner actions and help to infer learner context information; (c) the commodity wearable devices that are widely available on the market can provide a hassle-free and non-intrusive solution. Following the above observations and under the proposed framework, we design and implement a sensor-based learner context collector running on the wearable devices. The latest data mining and sensor data processing techniques are employed to detect different types of learner actions and context information. Furthermore, we detail all of the above efforts by offering a novel and exemplary use case: it successfully provides the accurate detection of student actions and infers the student engagement states in class. The specifically designed learner context collector has been implemented on the commodity wrist-worn device. Based on the collected and inferred learner information, the novel intervention and incentivizing feedback are introduced into the system service. Finally, a comprehensive evaluation with the real-world experiments, surveys and interviews demonstrates the effectiveness and impact of the proposed framework and this use case.

In a traditional class, the instructor would assess the students' level of attention. However, the assessment may not be accurate for a variety of reasons. Additionally, this creates a burden for the instructors. Wearable sensors and signal processing techniques could provide opportunities to assist teachers with this assessment. In this paper, we propose a methodology to model students' cognitive states by leveraging hand motion and heart activity captured with smart watches. Following the application of a sequence of signal processing techniques to the raw data, we generate features, which describe characteristics of the hand motion and heart activity in a group of students. The most prominent features are selected for machine learning algorithms. By applying cross validation, the results of experiments on 30 students in two lectures offer accuracies of 98.99% and 95.78% for predictions of 'interest level' and 'perception of difficulty' on the topics covered during the lectures. © 2017 IEEE.","classification; cognitive states; feature selection; inertial sensors; PPG","Biomedical signal processing; Body sensor networks; Classification (of information); Education; Education computing; Feature extraction; Learning algorithms; Signal processing; Students; Teaching; Wearable computers; Wearable technology; Cognitive state; Cross validation; Heart activities; Inertial sensor; Interest level; Prominent features; Quality of education; Signal processing technique; Wearable sensors","","","","","","","Stevens, Ronald H., EEG-related changes in cognitive workload, engagement and distraction as students acquire problem solving skills, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 4511 LNCS, pp. 187-196, (2007); P.-S., College students' conceptions of context-aware ubiquitous learning: A phenomenographic analysis, Internet and Higher Education, 14, 3, pp. 137-141, (2011); Y.-M., A ubiquitous English vocabulary learning system: Evidence of active/passive attitudes vs. usefulness/ease-of-use, Computers and Education, 58, 1, pp. 273-282, (2012); G.-J., A Heuristic Algorithm for planning personalized learning paths for context-aware ubiquitous learning, Computers and Education, 54, 2, pp. 404-415, (2010); C.-K., An adaptive navigation support system for conducting context-aware ubiquitous learning in museums, Computers and Education, 55, 2, pp. 834-845, (2010); H.-C., A knowledge engineering approach to developing mindtools for context-aware ubiquitous learning, Computers and Education, 54, 1, pp. 289-297, (2010); Y.-M., The design and implementation of a meaningful learning-based evaluation method for ubiquitous learning, Computers and Education, 57, 4, pp. 2291-2302, (2011); S.-L., Application of context-aware and personalized recommendation to implement an adaptive ubiquitous learning system, Expert Systems with Applications, 38, 9, pp. 10831-10838, (2011); C.-M., Interactive augmented reality system for enhancing library instruction in elementary schools, Computers and Education, 59, 2, pp. 638-652, (2012); Á., Impact of an augmented reality system on students' motivation for a visual art course, Computers and Education, 68, pp. 586-596, (2013)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE EMBS","14th IEEE International Conference on Wearable and Implantable Body Sensor Networks, BSN 2017","2017-05-09 through 2017-05-12","Eindhoven","128171","","9781509062447","","","English","IEEE Int.

An increasing number of researches have been emerged that assesses the cognitive aspects of video game players. This creates a need to classify the expert-novice level of a player. A novel approach to classify players expert-novice level is to use machine learning algorithm by considering recorded electroencephalography (EEG) signals of player while playing mobile games. In this research work, EEG signals of ten mobile game players is recorded by commercially available 14 channel EMOTIV headset. After preprocessing stage, a feature vector is created in such a way that from each channel, thirteen morphological features are extracted. The extracted features are used to train three different classification algorithms. The Naive Bayes performed with an accuracy of 89:89%. From results, it is evident that EEG can be used to classify the expert-novice level of a player using machine algorithms. These results can be useful in the development of new and interesting entertainment and educational mobile games taking into account the player's cognition using EEG. © 2016 IEEE.","Brain Computer Interface; EEG; Machine Learning; Mobile Game; Wearable Sensors","Artificial intelligence; Brain computer interface; Computer games; Education; Electroencephalography; Electrophysiology; Human computer interaction; Interfaces (computer); Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Wearable sensors; Classification algorithm; Cognitive aspects; EEG signals; Exponential increase; Feature vectors; Machine algorithm; Mobile games; Morphological features; Biomedical signal processing","","","","","","","Generation M2 Media in the Lives of 8 to 18 Year Olds, (2010); M.S., Action video game experience reduces the cost of switching tasks, Attention, Perception, and Psychophysics, 74, 4, pp. 641-647, (2012); J.L., Not so fast: Rethinking the effects of action video games on attentional capacity, Australian Journal of Psychology, 63, 4, pp. 224-231, (2011); Nijholt, Anton, Turning shortcomings into challenges: Brain-computer interfaces for games, Entertainment Computing, 1, 2, pp. 85-94, (2009); Salminen, Mikko J., Oscillatory brain responses evoked by video game events: The case of super monkey ball 2, Cyberpsychology and Behavior, 10, 3, pp. 330-338, (2007); Sheikholeslami, C., A high resolution EEG study of dynamic brain activity during video game play, Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology - Proceedings, pp. 2489-2491, (2007); J.R., Brain-computer interface technology: A review of the first international meeting, IEEE Transactions on Rehabilitation Engineering, 8, 2, pp. 164-173, (2000); A., Real time text speller based on eye movement classification using wearable EEG sensors, pp. 161-164, (2016); Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, (2004); F., A review of classification algorithms for EEG-based brain-computer interfaces, Journal of Neural Engineering, 4, 2, pp. R1-R13, (2007)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","14th International Conference on Frontiers of Information Technology, FIT 2016","2016-12-19 through 2016-12-21","Islamabad","126456","","9781509053001","","","English","Proc. - Int.

However, these types of depictions tend to mask the complexities associated with student life/learning. This study aims to investigate the degree to which the repetitive, mundane, and seemingly insignificant actions that define student daily life shape their academic development. In this talk we present a more holistic perspective of the students' educational experience grounded in daily student action. Drawing on the theoretical forms and concepts of Space-Event-Movement articulated by Bernard Tschumi in his book The Manhattan Transcripts, we went about transcribing a) the spaces in which students spend their time, b) the activities (events) they undertake in these spaces, and c) the movements or connectors that bind these spaces. Rather than following the traditional approach within higher education research of asking people questions, we experimented with new advances in digital data capture methods (e.g., reality mining through wearable sensor-based devices). This allowed us to harvest students continuous naturally-occurring behavioural data - 'what they were actually doing, rather than their perceptions, or what they say they did. Given the changing nature of higher education, it seems essential that we explore new and innovative ways to examine and probe the academic development of our undergraduate students. In this way, we hope the findings of this study will act as a catalyst to raise the profile of behaviour-centric research in shaping our understanding of student experience, development and wellbeing. © 2017 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

These indicators can be estimated through the use of widely available wearable device sensors, namely Commercial-Off-The-Shelf wrist wearables. The first step has been to validate the use of these devices and their sensors as good predictors of stress and sleep. Once this has been validated, we have proposed some indicators that offer the user the opportunity to get information such as the sleepiness quality, the chronotype, the latent stress of the stress regularity. These are different features that contribute to get a better knowledge of the learner and his state.

We then implement smartwatch-aided password authentication using the classifiers. Our scheme is user-friendly since it does not require users to perform any additional actions when typing passwords or PINs other than wearing smartwatches. We conduct a user study involving 51 participants on the developed prototype so as to evaluate its feasibility and performance. Experimental results show that the best classifier for our system is the Bagged Decision Trees, for which the accuracy is 4.58% FRR and 0.12% FAR on the QWERTY keyboard, and 6.13% FRR and 0.16% FAR on the numeric keypad. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Machine learning; Sensor; User authentication; Wearable devices","Artificial intelligence; Decision trees; Education; Learning systems; Sensors; Wearable computers; Wearable sensors; Motion sensors; Password authentication; Sensor data; Unique features; User authentication; User friendly; User study; Wearable devices; Authentication","","","","","National Research Foundation Singapore, NRF, (NRF2014NCR-NCR001-012); National Research Foundation Singapore, NRF; Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Youth Innovation Promotion Association, YIPA","This work is supported by the Singapore National Research Foundation under NCR Award Number NRF2014NCR-NCR001-012.

In informal learning, however, a deep understanding of learners and entities interacting with each other is needed. The practice of exploring these interactions is known as community learning analytics. Mobile devices, wearables and interconnected Industry 4.0 production machines equipped with a multitude of sensors collecting vast amounts of data are ideal candidates to capture the goals and activities of informal learning settings. What is missing is a methodological approach to collect, manage, analyze and exploit data coming from such an interconnected network of artifacts.

The platform integrates hardware (ambient and wearable sensors), as well as software components (data simulation tool, reasoning). Three sensors with different sensing principles are considered: a Time-Of-Flight camera, a MEMS wearable wireless accelerometer and an Ultra-Wideband radar. The inputs of the platform are the postural information, even simulated, in common to all involved sensors (i.e., Standing , Bending, Sitting, Lying down). Since they are extensively used both for analysis of Activities of Daily Living and human behaviour understanding. A posture simulator, calibrated on real experiments performed by each sensor involved in the platform, has been implemented in order to compensate the lack of wide datasets containing long-term data. Moreover, the platform integrates a reasoning layer for automatic sleep disorder evaluation by using an unsupervised learning technique. The effectiveness of the platform was demonstrated by preliminary results, exhibiting high accuracy in sleep disorder evaluation using the three aforementioned sensors. © 2017, CEUR-WS.

We describe and generalize the design methods we applied on the hardware and firmware. Our sensors employ Wi-Fi communication to move data as well as to localize themselves using a radio-map of Singapore. Our system uses embedded as well as server-based machine learning algorithms to perform on-sensor transportation mode identification and state inference. The testing and validation methods that we applied ensured that over 98% of the deployed sensors successfully met all of their design goals.

Through the use of sensors and wearables, innovative Connected Health applications can be developed. In particular, Digital Therapeutics (DT), a type of technology-enabled intervention, can be made possible through continuous data capture, aiding users through gaining feedback on their lifestyle choices and engagement with programs of recovery, and supplementing conventional treatments for chronic disease management such as diabetes, epilepsy, and mental health. Unfortunately, patient-facing professionals capable of articulating appropriate sensor-enabled solutions, generally lack the full range of skills to develop such systems. A connected health application may involve mobile development, data services, visualisation, machine learning, and sensor signal processing, needing multidisciplinary teams, including professional software engineers. The cost of maintaining a software team across the research and development stages may prove prohibitive for many, hindering innovation. This paper focuses on gathering requirements for data collection in mHealth studies, and reports the initial findings after a round of interviews with researchers in areas such as psychology, physiotherapy, neurology, and health promotion education. Those requirements are framed within an existing End User Development (EUD) tool to create mobile apps for the Android platform, the open source project MIT App Inventor. The survey results highlight not only the development work needed for App Inventor to be used as a data collection tool in DT, but also a number of potential security and privacy issues, and the implementation of a layered feedback loop with a social aspect at the heart of it. © 2016 ACM.","Android; App inventor; Behaviour change; Connected health; Data collection; End user development; Interventions; Mhealth; Sensors; Wearables","Android (operating system); Application programs; Artificial intelligence; Diseases; Feedback; Health; Human computer interaction; Learning systems; Neurology; Open source software; Sensors; Signal processing; Social aspects; Surveys; Wearable sensors; Wearable technology; Android; Behaviour changes; Data collection; End user development; Interventions; mHealth; Wearables; Data acquisition","","","","","","","Front Digit Humanit, (2015); D., AWARE: Mobile context instrumentation framework, Frontiers in ICT, 2, APR, (2015); Effectiveness of Mobile Health Technology Based Health Behaviour Change or Disease, (2013); Diss University of Dundee, (2014); End User Development, (2006); J MIT App Inventor Enabling Personal Mobile Computing, (2013); J., Monitoring Parkinson's Disease Progression Using Behavioural Inferences, Mobile Devices and Web Technologies, pp. 323-327, (2016); End User Development Eud, (2008); Med E Tel Global Telemedicines and Ehealth Updates Knowledge Resources","","Flynn, L.; Sillitti, A.","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc acmhelp@acm.org","ACM SIGPLAN","1st International Workshop on Mobile Development, Mobile! 2016","2016-10-31","Amsterdam","124457","","9781450346436","","","English","Mob.! - Proc.

This article explores how that potential could be realized through explicit acknowledgment of and response to tacit design assumptions about how such technologies will be used in practice and strategic design for use in a classroom. We argue that particular practical adaptations that we have identified serve to ensure that the classroom and educational use cases are appropriately considered. As an example of how those adaptations are realized in actual elementary classrooms, we describe an effort to provide fifth-grade students each with their own Fitbit activity trackers in the context of a multi-week unit exploring core ideas in elementary statistics. Observational descriptions and transcript excerpts of students and teachers discussing their own Fitbit data are presented to illustrate what opportunities exist to leverage youth familiarity with daily activities in a way that targets development of statistical thinking. Quantitative written test results showing learning gains and differences between traditional and wearable device-enhanced instruction are also presented. Improvement on several statistical thinking constructs is identified, including in the areas of data display, conceptions of statistics, modeling variability, and informal inference. © 2008-2011 IEEE.","Computers and education; devices for learning; user generated learning content","Activity tracking; Computers and education; Device for learning; Learning contents; Self-movements; Statistical thinking; Teaching and learning; Tracking devices; User generated learning content; User-generated","","","","","(DRL- 1054280); National Science Foundation, NSF, (1054280); National Science Foundation, NSF","The authors wish to thank the participating students, teachers, and student teachers.

In particular, the acquisition of motor skills could benefit from individualized instruction and support just as cognitive skills learning has over the last decades. To this point, procedural learning has been considered since the earliest days of AIED (dating back to the 1980's). However, AIED developments in motor skills learning have lagged significantly behind. As technology has evolved, and supported by the do-it-yourself and quantified-self movements, it is now possible to integrate emerging interactive technologies in order to provide personal awareness and reflection for behavioural change at low cost and with low intrusion. Many activities exist that would benefit from personalizing motor skills learning, such as playing a musical instrument, handwriting, drawing, training for surgery, improving the technique in sports and martial arts, learning sign language, dancing, etc. In this context, my suggestions for AIED research in the coming 25 years focus on addressing challenges regarding 1) modelling the psychomotor interaction, and 2) providing appropriate personalized psychomotor support. © 2016 International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society.","3D modelling; 3D printing; Ambient intelligence; Artificial intelligence; Big data; Education; Internet of me; Motor skills learning; Procedural learning; Psychomotor learning domain; Quantified-self; TORMES methodology; Wearable devices","3D printers; Artificial intelligence; Big data; Data handling; Education; Modeling languages; Printing; Wearable technology; 3-D printing; 3D modelling; Ambient intelligence; Motor skills; Procedural learning; Psychomotor learning domain; Quantified-self; TORMES methodology; Wearable devices; Personnel training","","","","","","","A., Investigating the translational and rotational motion of the swing using accelerometers for athlete skill assessment, Proceedings of IEEE Sensors, pp. 980-983, (2006); N., Narrative balance management in an intelligent biosafety training application for improving user performance, International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, 25, 1, pp. 35-59, (2015); C., Airwriting: A wearable handwriting recognition system, Personal and Ubiquitous Computing, 18, 1, pp. 191-203, (2014); J.R., Acquisition of cognitive skill, Psychological Review, 89, 4, pp. 369-406, (1982); International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, (1999); A Quaternion Based Motion Tracking and Gesture Recognition System Using Wireless Inertial Sensors, (2014); G.F., The effects of positive versus negative feedback on information-integration category learning, Perception and Psychophysics, 69, 6, pp. 865-878, (2007); A., Rapid feedback systems for elite sports training, IEEE Pervasive Computing, 5, 4, pp. 70-76, (2006); J., A network-based monitoring system for rehabilitation, IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics, AIM, pp. 232-237, (2012); International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, (2000)","O.C.

However, in the case of (often, half-improvised) teaching in face-to-face classrooms, such interventions would require first an understanding of what the teacher actually did, as the starting point for teacher reection and inquiry. Currently, such teacher enactment characterization requires costly manual coding by researchers. This paper presents a case study exploring the potential of machine learning techniques to automatically extract teaching actions during classroom enactment, from five data sources collected using wearable sensors (eye-tracking, EEG, accelerometer, audio and video). Our results highlight the feasibility of this approach, with high levels of accuracy in determining the social plane of interaction (90%, k=0.8). The reliable detection of concrete teaching activity (e.g., explanation vs. questioning) accurately still remains challenging (67%, k=0.56), a fact that will prompt further research on multimodal features and models for teaching activity extraction, as well as the collection of a larger multimodal dataset to improve the accuracy and generalizability of these methods. © 2016 ACM.","Activity detection; Multimodal learning analytics; Teacher reection; Teaching analytics; Wearable sensors","Artificial intelligence; Education; Extraction; Learning systems; Teaching; Wearable technology; Activity detection; Automatic extraction; Machine learning techniques; Multi-modal learning; Teacher reection; Teaching activities; Teaching analytics; Teaching and learning; Wearable sensors","","","","","","","Enhancing Teaching and Learning Through Educational Data Mining and Learning Analytics an Issue Brief, (2012); International Educational Data Mining Society, (2015); P., Multimodal learning analytics, ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, pp. 102-106, (2013); Breiman, Leo, Random forests, Machine Learning, 45, 1, pp. 5-32, (2001); D., The learning analytics cycle: Closing the loop effectively, ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, pp. 134-138, (2012); Statistical Power Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences, (1988); Orchestration Graphs Modeling Scalable Education, (2015); P., The evolution of research on computer-supported collaborative learning: From design to orchestration, pp. 3-19, (2009); P., Flexibility in macro-scripts for computer-supported collaborative learning, Journal of Computer Assisted Learning, 23, 1, pp. 1-13, (2007); S.K., Multimodal capture of teacher-student interactions for automated dialogic analysis in live classrooms, pp. 557-566, (2015)","","","Association for Computing Machinery acmhelp@acm.org","","6th International Conference on Learning Analytics and Knowledge, LAK 2016","2016-04-25 through 2016-04-29","Edinburgh","121386","21531633","9781450377881; 9781450385855; 9781450314398; 9781450396387; 9781450390019; 9781450390217; 9781450348270; 9781450381963; 9781450322485; 9781450348201","","","English","ACM Int.

But, to the best of our knowledge, nobody has ever built an actual device that implements this function. Therefore we present the ""Inventometer"", a fun and playful wearable device that measures and displays epiphanometric data to a real light bulb, so its wearer and others in the environment are alerted to ""aha! moments"" (""eureka moments""), epiphanies, inventions, and idea formation in the brain/mind of the wearer. It senses brainwave signals indicative of epiphanies, and indicates to others a continuously varying epiphanometric quantity by adjusting the light output of the bulb. It uses simple machine learning on EEG (electroencephalogaph) brainwave signals to automatically detect and quantify the novelty of ideas formed in the brain. Long exposure photographs - made while one or more Inventometer wearers walk around a room - result in a Phenomenal Augmented Reality (Augmented Reality of or pertaining to physical phenomena and phenomenology). In particular, these ""epiphanographs"", over time, indicate what sorts of things in an environment tended to stimulate epiphanies and to what degree - epiphanogrammetry as a possible new field of study. Brain Games are designed so multiple people can compete using their minds much like people competing using their bodies (e.g. arm wrestling). The ""brightest"" people in a room become visible by way of their epiphanographs. But with their wearable display bulbs glowing brightly, they also serve as a distraction to each other, thus introducing a richly complex and competitive collective biofeedback gaming space. The device is meant to appeal to people of all ages, from children to university students, and thus forms a good teaching for making skills, science, and engineering (e.g. power electronics, 3D printing, etc.).

In this paper, we investigate if machine-learning classifiers offer the discriminative power for the diagnosis of AD based on postural control kinematics. We compared Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Multiple Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (RBNs), and Deep Belief Networks (DBNs) on 72 participants (36 AD patients and 36 healthy subjects) exposed to seven increasingly difficult postural tasks. The decisional space was composed of 18 kinematic variables (adjusted for age, education, height, and weight), with or without neuropsychological evaluation (Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) score), top ranked in an error incremental analysis. Classification results were based on threefold cross validation of 50 independent and randomized runs sets: training (50%), test (40%), and validation (10%). Having a decisional space relying solely on postural kinematics, accuracy of AD diagnosis ranged from 71.7 to 86.1%. Adding the MoCA variable, the accuracy ranged between 91 and 96.6%. MLP classifier achieved top performance in both decisional spaces. Having comprehended the interdynamic interaction between postural stability and cognitive performance, our results endorse machine-learning models as a useful tool for computer-aided diagnosis of AD based on postural control kinematics. © 2016 Luís Costa et al.","","Artificial intelligence; Computer aided diagnosis; Computer aided instruction; Diagnosis; Disease control; Kinematics; Learning systems; Radial basis function networks; Support vector machines; Classification results; Cognitive assessments; Cognitive performance; Discriminative power; Machine learning models; Neurodegenerative disorders; Radial basis function neural networks; Support vector machine (SVMs); Neurodegenerative diseases; aged; Alzheimer disease; artificial neural network; biomechanics; body equilibrium; body posture; complication; computer assisted diagnosis; female; human; machine learning; male; physiology; psychological rating scale; sensitivity and specificity; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Biomechanical Phenomena; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; Female; Humans; Machine Learning; Male; Neural Networks (Computer); Postural Balance; Posture; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Sensitivity and Specificity","","","","","","","P., Prevention of falls and consequent injuries in elderly people, The Lancet, 366, 9500, pp. 1885-1893, (2005); A., Falls incidence underestimates the risk of fall-related injuries in older age groups: A comparison with the FARE (Falls risk by exposure), Age and Ageing, 41, 2, pp. 190-195, (2012); A., Attentional demands and postural control: The effect of sensory context, Journals of Gerontology - Series A Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences, 55, 1, pp. M10-M16, (2000); G., Using Support Vector Machine to identify imaging biomarkers of neurological and psychiatric disease: A critical review, Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews, 36, 4, pp. 1140-1152, (2012); A., EEG signal classification using PCA, ICA, LDA and support vector machines, Expert Systems with Applications, 37, 12, pp. 8659-8666, (2010); C., Application and comparison of classification algorithms for recognition of Alzheimer's disease in electrical brain activity (EEG), Journal of Neuroscience Methods, 161, 2, pp. 342-350, (2007); C., Different multivariate techniques for automated classification of MRI data in Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment, Psychiatry Research - Neuroimaging, 212, 2, pp. 89-98, (2013); J., Independent component analysis-based multimodal classification of Alzheimer's disease versus healthy controls, Proceedings - International Conference on Natural Computation, pp. 75-79, (2013); F., Longitudinal FDG-PET features for the classification of Alzheimer's disease, pp. 1941-1944, (2014); Q., An optimal decisional space for the classification of alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment, IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering, 61, 8, pp. 2245-2253, (2014)","M.F.

To verify this hypothesis an experiment was set up involving eight doctoral students at the Open University of the Netherlands. Through wearable sensors, heart rate and step count were constantly monitored and learning activity data were collected. All data were stored in a Learning Record Store in xAPI format. Additionally, with an Activity Rating Tool, the participants rated their learning and working experience by indicating the perceived levels of productivity, stress, challenge and abilities along with the type of activity. These human annotated labels can be used for supervising machine learning algorithms to discriminate the successful learning moments from the unsuccessful ones and eventually discover the attributes that most influence the learning process. © Copyright 2016 for this paper by its authors.","Affective computing; Biosensors; Learning analytics; Wearable enhanced learning","Artificial intelligence; Biosensors; Heart; Learning systems; Wearable technology; Activity ratings; Affective Computing; Enhanced learning; Learning Activity; Learning analytics; Open universities; Physiological data; Self-regulated learning; Learning algorithms","","","","","","","Engineering Psychophysiology Issues and Applications, (2000); D.L., Feedback and Self-Regulated Learning: A Theoretical Synthesis, Review of Educational Research, 65, 3, pp. 245-281, (1995); Finding Flow the Psychology of Engagement with Everyday Life, (1997); Ecar Working Group Paper, (2015); Lak, (2016); Scholarship of Teaching and Learning in Higher Education an Evidence Based Perspective, (2007); R.M., Self-determination theory and the facilitation of intrinsic motivation, social development, and well-being, American Psychologist, 55, 1, pp. 68-78, (2000); J., Augmenting the senses: A review on sensor-based learning support, Sensors, 15, 2, pp. 4097-4133, (2015); G., Learning analytics and educational data mining: Towards communication and collaboration, ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, pp. 252-254, (2012); D., A unified framework for multi-level analysis of distributed learning, ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, pp. 64-74, (2011)","","Martinez-Maldonado, R.; Hernandez-Leo, D.","CEUR-WS","","1st International Workshop on Learning Analytics Across Physical and Digital Spaces, CrossLAK 2016","2016-04-25 through 2016-04-29","Edinburgh, Scotland","122223","16130073","9789666544899; 9788073780029; 9788024810256; 9789986342748; 9788073781712; 9782954494807; 9788024823911; 9789562361989; 8024810255; 807378002X","","","English","CEUR Workshop Proc.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84977624486"

Wearable technologies can serve as a valuable asset in the classroom enhancing differentiation of instruction and student engagement. They also can assist students with a variety of physical limitations. Data collection from these wearable personalized learning technologies enables the building of student profiles—leading to a “quantified” self for assessment and instruction. However, the proliferation of wearable devices may also increase concerns about privacy and security of data, dependence on outside vendors for storage and analysis of big data, and access by students of all socioeconomic levels. Addressing these issues in the teacher education curricula suggests added emphasis on affordances for instruction, digital citizenship, and a code of ethics related to data use.

Despite all the progress, we cannot ignore the fact that the conditions provided by the society for the deaf are still far from being perfect. The communication with deaf by means of written text is not as efficient as it might seem at first. In fact, there is a very deep gap between sign language and spoken/written language. The vocabulary, the sentence construction and the grammatical rules are quite different among these two worlds. These facts bring significant difficulties in reading and understanding the meaning of text for deaf people and, on the other hand, make it quite difficult for people with no hearing disabilities to understand sign language. The deployment of tools to assist the daily communication, in schools, in public services, in museums and other, between deaf people and the rest may be a significant contribution to the social inclusion of the deaf community. The work described in this paper addresses the development of a bidirectional translator between Portuguese Sign Language and Portuguese text. The translator from sign language to text resorts to two devices, namely the Microsoft Kinect and 5DT Sensor Gloves in order to gather data about the motion and shape of the hands. The hands configurations are classified using Support Vector Machines. The classification of the movement and orientation of the hands are achieved through the use of Dynamic Time Warping algorithm.

In fact, there is a very deep gap between sign language and spoken/written language. The deployment of tools to assist the daily communication between deaf people and the rest may be a significant contribution to the social inclusion of the deaf community. The work described in this paper addresses the development of a bidirectional translator between Portuguese Sign Language and Portuguese text and a serious game to promote the learning of the Portuguese Sign Language. The translator from sign language to text employs two devices, namely the Microsoft Kinect and 5DT Sensor Gloves in order to gather data about the motion and shape of the hands. The hands configurations are classified using Support Vector Machines. The classification of the movement and orientation of the hands is achieved through the use of Dynamic Time Warping algorithm. The translator exhibits a precision higher than 90%. In the other direction, the translation of Portuguese text to Portuguese Sign Language is supported by a 3D avatar which interprets the entered text and performs the corresponding animations. As a complement, we also present a serious game directed to assist in the difficult task of learning the Portuguese Sign Language.","Avatar; Deaf; Dynamic Time Warping; Education; Kinect; Machine learning; Opencv; Portuguese Sign Language; Sensor Gloves; Serious games; Support Vector Machines; Translator","Animation; Education; Information systems; Information use; Learning systems; Serious games; Support vector machines; Three dimensional computer graphics; Wearable sensors; Avatar; Deaf; Dynamic time warping; Kinect; Opencv; Sensor gloves; Sign language; Translator; Translation (languages)","","","","","","","Vulnerable Groups Inclusion, (2011); Associacao De Surdos do Porto Algumas Definicoes Uteis Sobre A Surdez; Lingua Gestual Portuguesa; Workshop Example Based Machine Translation Mt X 05, (2005); J., Kinect-sign: Teaching sign language to “listeners” through a game, IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology, 425, pp. 141-159, (2014); Ensino Da Lingua Gestual Assistido Por Personagens 3D Virtuais, (2002); T.A.C., Real-time video based finger spelling recognition system using low computational complexity artificial neural networks, pp. 393-397, (2006); N., Spelling it out: Real-time ASL fingerspelling recognition, Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 1114-1119, (2011); X Encontro Anual De Computacao, (2013); Breiman, Leo, Random forests, Machine Learning, 45, 1, pp. 5-32, (2001)","","Monfort, V.; Krempels, K.-H.; Majchrzak, T.A.; Turk, Z.; Turk, Z.","SciTePress","Institute for Systems and Technologies of Information, Control and Communication (INSTICC)","11th International Conference on Web Information Systems and Technologies, WEBIST 2015","2015-05-20 through 2015-05-22","Lisbon","112642","","9789897581069","","","English","WEBIST - Int.

In this paper, we are trying to develop a game-based learning system for martial arts that required emphasis of gesture movement with the aid of Kinect sensor. Emergence of controller-less sensors in gaming industry was said to exhibit the potential of bringing joy and fun into teaching and learning experience. We had seen many commercialized controller-less sensors that enhanced the game experience, brought us one step closer to the virtual reality. No doubts, games have unique opportunity to create experiences that unfold over long span of time. Why not we have them kill two birds with one stone? Besides the pleasure brought by the game, we can have the player indirectly learn the real sport through the game play and subsequently train them within the long span of time during game play. Our main idea is to unobtrusively teach player about martial arts during the game play. We have chosen Kinect sensor for its affordability and ease of programming. We have evaluated accuracy of Kinect sensor for motions capture by developing a simple program in Xcode with OpenNI framework and NITE middleware to estimate the player's height by retrieving joint points coordinates information. We have obtained the results of 100% user detection rate, high accuracy but low precision for height estimation with Kinect. This analysis convinced that Kinect is suitable to replace wearable sensor and to fit in our system with proper adjustment and arrangement. © 2012 IEEE.","edutainment; game-based learning; Kinect; martial arts; serious game","Edutainment; Game-based Learning; Kinect; Martial art; Serious games; Embedded systems; Middleware; SportS; Virtual reality; Sensors","","","","","","","Giunti, (2004); Digital Game Based Learning, (2001); Proceedings of the Interservice Industry Training Simulation Education Conference, (2007); Encyclopedia of Human Computer Interaction, (2012); D., Games are made for fun"": Lessons on the effects of concept maps in the classroom use of computer games, Computers and Education, 56, 3, pp. 604-615, (2011); 2nd International Conference on Education and Management Technology, (2011); T., Physical instructional support system using virtual avatars, pp. 262-265, (2012); S., Edutainment - Thai art of self-defense and boxing by motion capture technique, pp. 152-155, (2009); P., Martial arts in artificial reality, Cost Engineering (Morgantown, West Virginia), pp. 781-790, (2005); M., A dance training system that maps self-images onto an instruction video, pp. 309-314, (2012)","C.

Continuous enhancements in computer technology and the current widespread computer literacy among the public have resulted in a new generation of users (less so in developing countries) that expect increasingly more from their e-learning experiences. To keep up with such expectations, e-learning systems have gone through a radical change from the initial text-based environments to more stimulating multimedia systems (Monahan, McArdle & Bertolotto, in press). Generally a collaborative virtual environment (CVE) can be defined as a computer-based, distributed, virtual space or set of places. In such places, people can meet and interact with others, with agents (artificial intelligence), or with virtual objects. CVEs might vary in their representational richness from 3D graphical spaces, 2.5D and 2D environments, to text-based environments. Access to CVEs is by no means limited to desktop devices, but might well include mobile or wearable devices, public kiosks, and so forth (Churchill, Snowdon & Munro, 2001). CVEs are a subset of Virtual Environments (VEs) in that only VEs which support collaborative operations can be considered CVEs. The two primary uses of CVEs are for collaborative learning and/or collaborative work in either educational and/or professional environments. Computer supported collaborative learning (CSCL) is an umbrella term for a variety of approaches in education that involve the joint intellectual effort by students or students and teachers and that require the use of computer and communication technology. Researchers (e.g., Ahern, Peck & Laycock, 1992; Bruckman & Hudson, 2001; Singhal & Zyda, 1990) have proven the effectiveness of collaborative learning compared to other educational practices (e.g., competitive or personalized learning), praising this method’s way of aiding the acquisition of higher level cognitive abilities, problem solving abilities, ease in scientific expression and the development of communication, social and higher order thinking skills. The most important advantages of using CSCL are discussed in Bruckman et al. (2002). It is mentioned that through CSCL teacher/student interactions become more balanced and that there is also some evidence to suggest that gender differences are reduced in online environments. In addition, students exhibit higher levels of attention and appear more honest and candid toward those in a position of authority. Learning becomes more student-oriented, thus increasing the likelihood that students will absorb and remember what they learn. On the other hand, computer supported collaborative work (CSCW) is a generic term, which combines the understanding of the way people work in groups with the enabling technologies of computer networking, and associated hardware, software, services and techniques (Wilson, 1991). Although some authors consider CSCW and groupware as synonyms, others argue that that while groupware refers to real computer-based systems, CSCW focuses on the study of tools and techniques of groupware as well as their psychological, social, and organizational effects. For example, researchers Hiltz and Turoff (1993) conclude that the social connectivity of users who adopt a computer-mediated communication system increases notably. They also found a strong tendency toward more equal participation, and that more opinions tended to be asked for and offered. The purpose of this chapter is to present a concise yet complete overview of collaborative virtual environments. In the following sections we will discuss the technological evolution of CVEs, their basic characteristics and architectures, and the tools and services integrated within them. Finally, there will be a brief mention of the design challenges facing CVE designers and of future trends with which CVE functionality will be extended. © 2009 by IGI Global.
